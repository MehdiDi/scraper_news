The meta-analysis by researchers at the University of Warwick with data from up to 4.4 million adult participants showed that those born preterm are 28% less likely to ever be in a romantic relationship.                                           A meta-analysis conducted by researchers from the Department of Psychology at the University of Warwick has published 'Association of Preterm Birth/Low Birth Weight with Romantic Partnership, Sexual Intercourse and Parenthood in Adulthood: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis' in JAMA Network Open today, 12th of July.

However, studies also show that forming those relationships is harder for pre-term born adults, as they are usually timid, socially withdrawn and low in risk-taking and fun seeking.Despite having fewer close relationships, this meta-analysis also revealed that when preterm born adults had friends or a partner, the quality of these relationships was at least as good in preterms compared to full term born adults.meta-analysisFirst author of the paper, Dr. Marina Goulart de Mendonça from the Department of Psychology at the University of Warwick comments:""The finding that adults who were born pre-term are less likely to have a partner, to have sex and become parents does not appear to be explained by a higher rate of disability. Rather preterm born children have been previously found to have poorer social interactions in childhood that make it harder for them to master social transitions such as finding a partner, which in turn is proven to boost your wellbeing.""The senior author, Professor Dieter Wolke, from the Department of Psychology at the University of Warwick adds:""Those caring for preterm children including parent's health professionals and teachers should be more aware of the important role of social development and social integration for pre-term children. As preterm children tend to be more timid and shy, supporting them making friends and be integrated in their peer group will help them to find romantic partners, have sexual relationships and to become parents.

Creating two-dimensional layered Zintl phase by dimensional manipulation of the crystal structure,https://phys.org/news/2019-07-two-dimensional-layered-zintl-phase-dimensional.html,https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/csz/news/325u/2019/creatingtwod.jpg,Physics,"July 12, 2019","The discovery of new families of two-dimensional (2-D) layered materials beyond graphene has always attracted great attention, but it remains challenging to artificially recreate the honeycomb atomic lattice structure with multi-components such as hexagonal boron nitride in the lab. In a new study now published on Science Advances, Junseong Song and colleagues at the departments of Energy Science, Nanostructure Physics, Environmental Science and Materials Science in the Republic of Korea developed an unprecedented structure of the Zintl phase.                                               Science AdvancesThey constructed the material by staking sp2-hybridized honeycomb ZnSb layers and via the dimensional manipulation of a crystal structure from the sp3-hybridized 3-D-ZnSb state. The materials scientists combined structural analysis with theoretical calculations to form a stable and robust layered structure of 2-D-ZnSb. This phenomenon of bi-dimensional polymorphism was not previously observed at ambient pressure in Zintl families. Therefore, the new work provides a rational design strategy to search and create new 2-D layered materials in various compounds. The new results will allow the unlimited expansion of 2-D libraries and their corresponding physical properties.  sp2-hybridizedsp3-hybridizedmaterials scientistsstructural analysisThe advent of Dirac physics of graphene triggered an explosive interest in research on two-dimensional (2-D) materials with varied applications in electronics, magnetics, energy and chemistry to quantum physics. At present, 2-D research is primarily focused on a few 2-D materials containing a single or several atomic layers exfoliated from their mother compounds, in contrast to 2-D atomic crystals such as silicone. This can restrict the method of 2-D materials development to two approaches of exfoliation and chemical vapor deposition. It is therefore highly desirable to expand on 2-D materials research to artificially create a new 2-D material with a new synthetic approach and form a variety of material groups. electronicsmagneticsenergyquantum physicsfew 2-D materialsseveral atomic layers2-D atomic crystals such as siliconeexfoliationchemical vapor depositionIn new materials discovery, transformation of a crystal structure is a widely recognized key factor. Where the temperature-pressure and electrostatic-doping induced structural phase transitions are core to explore a new crystal structure or to switch 2-D materials properties. For instance, most transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit polymorphic phase transition to access inherently diverse properties including superconducting and topological states. The transition has led to promising applications including electronic homojunction, photonic memory devices and catalytic energy materials. explore a new crystal structureswitch 2-D materialsmetal dichalcogenideselectronic homojunctioncatalytic energy materialsThese polymorphic transitions only occurred between different layered structures in the same two dimensions and remain to be realized between different dimensions of a crystal structure at ambient pressure. To reach ultimate crystal engineering and alter the structural dimension of multicomponent compounds is a promising next frontier in materials science beyond the allotropes of carbon. materials scienceallotropes of carbonIn the present work, Song et al. established bidimensional polymorphism via the discovery of 2-D layered structures in Zintl phases containing a large number of chemical compositions. Due to the sp2 hybrid orbital bonding of honeycomb-structured 2-D atomic crystals such as graphene and hexagonal boron nitride, the scientists expected the 3-D structured Zintl phases (with sp3 hybrid orbital bonding) to transform to sp2 honeycomb structured 2-D layered materials, as well, via electron transfer. As a proof-of-concept, Song et al. selected a 3-D orthorhombic ZnSb (3-D-ZnSb) Zintl phase and created the unprecedented, 2-D layered structure of ZnSb (2-D-ZnSb).bidimensional polymorphismcontaining a large number of chemical compositionsorthorhombicIn the new method, Song et al. first synthesized layered AZnSb (2-D-AZnSb) ternary compounds; where A referred to an alkali metal such as Na, Li and K. The materials contained a layered structure of ZnSb by transforming 3-D-ZnSb via A alloying, although the phases could be independently synthesized. Song et al. performed selective etching of A ions to create the 2-D-ZnSb in two different processes, including (1) chemical reaction in deionized water-incorporated solutions, and (2) electrochemical ion etching reaction in alkali-based electrolyte. ternary compoundsindependently synthesizedFor example, they synthesized the polycrystalline and single crystalline 2-D-LiZnSb intermediate substrate by first alloying Li into polycrystalline 3-D-ZnSb, followed by Li ion etching to form a 2-D-ZnSb crystal. The scientists easily cleaned the Li-etched 2-D-ZnSb crystals using adhesive tape exfoliation as mechanical cleaving to exhibit a typical flat surface as reported for 2-D materials.a typical flat surface as reported for 2-D materialsTo understand the effect of the manufacturing process, they examined the role of Li alloying and etching on structural transformations using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements to reveal the difference between the 2-D and 3-D crystals. To further validate their findings, Song et al. used X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD) patterns, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations and scanning tunneling electron microscopy (STEM) combined with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping to confirm the atomic structure of 2-D-ZnSb.scanning tunneling electron microscopyenergy-dispersive spectroscopyBased on the results, the scientists interpreted the stretchable interlayer distances between both Zn-Zn and Sb-Sb atoms as weak interlayer bonds and verified that the 2-D-ZnSb could be exfoliated as a layered material. The newly evolved layered structure of 2-D-ZnSb in the present work, completed the first discovery of bidimensional polymorphism in Zintl phases at ambient pressure. Accordingly, Song et al. manipulated the sp3-hybridized bonding state in 3-D-ZnSb into the sp2 state in 2-D-ZnSb honeycomb lattice. Previous studies on polymorphic transitions between 3-D and 2-D structures in Zintl phases were only observed under high pressure. The present results on bidimensional polymorphism between 3-D-ZnSb and 2-D-ZnSb emphasized the potential and broad availability of such an electron transfer to transform the crystal structure.  observed under high pressureSong et al. next investigated electrical transport properties of bidimensional ZnSb polymorphs and 2-D-LiZnSb crystals alongside first principles calculations of their electronic energy band structure. In contrast to the semiconducting nature of 3-D-ZnSb, both 2-D-LiZnSb and 2-D-ZnSb showed metallic conduction behavior. When they decreased the temperature, the electrical mobilities of both 2-D-LiZnSb and 2-D-ZnSb increased to a value higher than that of 3-D-ZnSb. The scientists credited the observed enlarged bandwidths for 2-D-ZnSb to the enhanced sp2 nature of honeycomb-structured layers with weakened interlayer interactions that formed the semi-metal. They used theoretical calculations to confirm that 2-D-ZnSb could be mechanically exfoliated into the bilayer to exist in an energetically stable form as a 2-D material, while the monolayer of 2-D-ZnSb was energetically unfavorable.structureTo demonstrate structural transformation of bidimensional ZnSb polymorphs during 2-D-LiZnSb formation, the scientists conducted synchrotron XRD - during the electrochemical reaction. They observed peaks corresponding to Li alloying of 3-D-ZnSb at pure 2-D-LiZnSb formation, followed by the final product of 2-D-ZnSb. During the electrochemical reaction, the Li atoms selectively penetrated into 3-D-ZnSb to break the Zn-Sb and Sb-Sb bonds. At the level of electron transfer, the hybridized bonding state changed from sp3 in 3-D-ZnSb to sp2 in 2-D-LiZnSb to form the puckered honeycomb lattice.      synchrotron XRDThe outcome of Li alloying based 2-D-LiZnSb transformation yielded the 2-D-ZnSb product, which did not return to its 3-D form. Song et al. showed that once formed, the layered 2-D-ZnSb was a stable material with a honeycomb architecture, validating the stable bidimensional polymorphic transition. The scientists anticipate applications of the new material in sustainable alkali ion batteries. In this way, Junseong Song and co-workers performed rigorous experimental and theoretical studies to demonstrate the creation of 2-D layered Zintl phases by manipulating the structural dimensionality. The new method is a first to establish the bidimensional polymorphic family in Zintl phases at ambient pressure, to allow new phase transformations as a general route of synthesis. This work provides a rational design strategy to explore new 2-D layered materials and unlock further properties of interest within materials, such as 2-D magnetism, ferroelectricity, thermoelectricity and topological states for further applications.                                                                                                                        materials                                                © 2019 Science X Network                                            "
Identifying perceived emotions from people's walking style,https://techxplore.com/news/2019-07-emotions-people-style.html,https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/csz/news/325u/2019/identifyingp.jpg,Machine Learning & AI,"July 12, 2019","A team of researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Maryland at College Park has recently developed a new deep learning model that can identify people's emotions based on their walking styles. Their approach, outlined in a paper pre-published on arXiv, works by extracting an individual's gait from an RGB video of him/her walking, then analyzing it and classifying it as one of four emotions: happy, sad, angry or neutral.                                              pre-published on arXiv""Emotions play a significant role in our lives, defining our experiences, and shaping how we view the world and interact with other humans,"" Tanmay Randhavane, one of the primary researchers and a graduate student at UNC, told TechXplore. ""Perceiving the emotions of other people helps us understand their behavior and decide our actions toward them. For example, people communicate very differently with someone they perceive to be angry and hostile than they do with someone they perceive to be calm and contented.""Most existing emotion recognition and identification tools work by analyzing facial expressions or voice recordings. However, past studies suggest that body language (e.g., posture, movements, etc.) can also say a lot about how someone is feeling. Inspired by these observations, the researchers set out to develop a tool that can automatically identify the perceived emotion of individuals based on their walking style. emotion recognition""The main advantage of our perceived emotion recognition approach is that it combines two different techniques,"" Randhavane said. ""In addition to using deep learning, our approach also leverages the findings of psychological studies. A combination of both these techniques gives us an advantage over the other methods.""deep learningThe approach first extracts a person's walking gait from an RGB video of them walking, representing it as a series of 3-D poses. Subsequently, the researchers used a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network and a random forest (RF) classifier to analyze these poses and identify the most prominent emotion felt by the person in the video, choosing between happiness, sadness, anger or neutral. The LSTM is initially trained on a series of deep features, but these are later combined with affective features computed from the gaits using posture and movement cues. All of these features are ultimately classified using the RF classifier. Randhavane and his colleagues carried out a series of preliminary tests on a dataset containing videos of people walking and found that their model could identify the perceived emotions of individuals with 80 percent accuracy. In addition, their approach led to an improvement of approximately 14 percent over other perceived emotion recognition methods that focus on people's walking style. ""Though we do not make any claims about the actual emotions a person is experiencing, our approach can provide an estimate of the perceived emotion of that walking style,"" Aniket Bera, a Research Professor in the Computer Science department, supervising the research, told TechXplore. ""There are many applications for this research, ranging from better human perception for robots and autonomous vehicles to improved surveillance to creating more engaging experiences in augmented and virtual reality.""Along with Tanmay Randhavane and Aniket Bera, the research team behind this study includes Dinesh Manocha and Uttaran Bhattacharya at the University of Maryland at College Park, as well as Kurt Gray and Kyra Kapsaskis from the psychology department of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  To train their deep learning model, the researchers have also compiled a new dataset called Emotion Walk (EWalk), which contains videos of individuals walking in both indoor and outdoor settings labeled with perceived emotions. In the future, this dataset could be used by other teams to develop and train new emotion recognition tools designed to analyze movement, posture, and/or gait.  ""Our research is at a very primitive stage,"" Bera said. ""We want to explore different aspects of the body language and look at more cues such as facial expressions, speech, vocal patterns, etc., and use a multi-modal approach to combine all these cues with gaits. Currently, we assume that the walking motion is natural and does not involve any accessories (e.g., suitcase, mobile phones, etc.). As part of future work, we would like to collect more data and train our deep-learning model better. We will also attempt to extend our methodology to consider more activities such as running, gesturing, etc."" According to Bera, perceived emotion recognition tools could soon help to develop robots with more advanced navigation, planning, and interaction skills. In addition, models such as theirs could be used to detect anomalous behaviors or walking patterns from videos or CCTV footage, for instance identifying individuals who are at risk of suicide and alerting authorities or healthcare providers. Their model could also be applied in the VFX and animation industry, where it could assist designers and animators in creating virtual characters that effectively express particular emotions.                                                                                                                                                                        © 2019 Science X Network                                            "

Solving the problems mathematically is beyond the capabilities of modern computers, so scientists at Princeton University have turned to an unusual branch of geometry instead.                                               Researchers led by Andrew Houck, a professor of electrical engineering, have built an electronic array on a microchip that simulates particle interactions in a hyperbolic plane, a geometric surface in which space curves away from itself at every point. A hyperbolic plane is difficult to envision—the artist M.C. Escher used hyperbolic geometry in many of his mind-bending pieces—but is perfect for answering questions about particle interactions and other challenging mathematical questions.particle interactionshyperbolic geometryThe research team used superconducting circuits to create a lattice that functions as a hyperbolic space. When the researchers introduce photons into the lattice, they can answer a wide range of difficult questions by observing the photons' interactions in simulated hyperbolic space.""You can throw particles together, turn on a very controlled amount of interaction between them, and see the complexity emerge,"" said Houck, who was the senior author of the paper published July 4 in the journal Nature.NatureAlicia Kollár, a postdoctoral research associate at the Princeton Center for Complex Materials and the study's lead author, said the goal is to allow researchers to address complex questions about quantum interactions, which govern the behavior of atomic and subatomic particles.""The problem is that if you want to study a very complicated quantum mechanical material, then that computer modeling is very difficult. We're trying to implement a model at the hardware level so that nature does the hard part of the computation for you,"" said Kollár.The centimeter-sized chip is etched with a circuit of superconducting resonators that provide paths for microwave photons to move and interact. The resonators on the chip are arranged in a lattice pattern of heptagons, or seven-sided polygons. The structure exists on a flat plane, but simulates the unusual geometry of a hyperbolic plane.""In normal 3-D space, a hyperbolic surface doesn't exist,"" said Houck. ""This material allows us to start to think about mixing quantum mechanics and curved space in a lab setting.""Trying to force a three-dimensional sphere onto a two-dimensional plane reveals that space on a spherical plane is smaller than on a flat plane. This is why the shapes of countries appear stretched out when drawn on a flat map of the spherical Earth. In contrast, a hyperbolic plane would need to be compressed in order to fit onto a flat plane.""It's a space that you can mathematically write down, but it's very difficult to visualize because it's too big to fit in our space,"" explained Kollár.To simulate the effect of compressing hyperbolic space onto a flat surface, the researchers used a special type of resonator called a coplanar waveguide resonator. When microwave photons pass through this resonator, they behave in the same way whether their path is straight or meandering. The meandering structure of the resonators offers flexibility to ""squish and scrunch"" the sides of the heptagons to create a flat tiling pattern, said Kollár.Looking at the chip's central heptagon is akin to looking through a fisheye camera lens, in which objects at the edge of the field of view appear smaller than in the center—the heptagons look smaller the farther they are from the center. This arrangement allows microwave photons that move through the resonator circuit to behave like particles in a hyperbolic space.The chip's ability to simulate curved space could enable new investigations in quantum mechanics, including properties of energy and matter in the warped space-time around black holes. The material could also be useful for understanding complex webs of relationships in mathematical graph theory and communication networks. Kollár noted that this research could eventually aid the design of new materials.quantum mechanicsspaceBut first, Kollár and her colleagues will need to further develop the photonic material, both by continuing to examine its mathematical basis and by introducing elements that enable photons in the circuit to interact.""By themselves, microwave photons don't interact with each other—they pass right through,"" said Kollár. Most applications of the material would require ""doing something to make it so that they can tell there's another photon there.""

Such a failure was not an option during the Apollo missions, the first time ever that a computer was entrusted with handling flight control and life support systems—and therefore the lives of the astronauts on board. flight controllife support systemsDespite an infamous false alarm during lunar descent that sent Commander Neil Armstrong's heart rate racing, it was a resounding success that laid the groundwork for everything from modern avionics to multitasking operating systems.Here are some of the ways the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC), millions of times less powerful than a 2019 smartphone, shaped the world we live in today:Microchip revolutionMicrochip revolutionIntegrated circuits, or microchips, were a necessary part of the miniaturization process that allowed computers to be placed on board spacecraft, in contrast to the giant, power-hungry vacuum tube technology that came before.The credit for their invention goes to Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments, and Robert Noyce, who co-founded Fairchild Semiconductor and later Intel in Mountain View, California. But NASA and the Department of Defense—which needed microchips to guide their Minuteman ballistic missiles pointed at the Soviet Union—greatly accelerated their development by producing the demand that facilitated mass production.mass production""They had these incredible, absolutely insane requirements for reliability that nobody could possibly imagine,"" Frank O'Brien, a spaceflight historian and author of ""The Apollo Guidance Computer: Architecture and Operation,"" told AFP.In the early 1960s, the two agencies bought almost all the microchips made in the US, roughly a million all told, added O'Brien, forcing the makers to improve their designs and build circuits that lasted longer than their early life cycles of just a few hours.MultitaskingMultitaskingModern computers, such as the smartphone in your pocket, are generally capable of doing a myriad of tasks all at once: handling emails in one window, a GPS map in another, various social network apps, all the while ready for incoming calls and texts. But in the early era of computers, we thought of them in a fundamentally different way. ""There wasn't a lot they were asked to do. They were asked to crunch numbers and replace humans who would do them on mechanical adding machines,"" said Seamus Tuohy, the principal director of space systems at Draper, which spun off from the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory that developed the Apollo Guidance Computer.That all changed with Apollo Guidance Computer, a briefcase-sized machine that needed to juggle an array of vital tasks, from navigating the ship to running its oxygen generator, heaters and carbon dioxide scrubbers.Instead of a computer operator giving a machine a set of calculations and leaving it for hours or even days to work out the answer—all of this needed to be done in a time-sensitive fashion, with cut-offs, and the ability for users (astronauts) to give it commands in real time.real timeNASA felt it required an onboard computer to handle all these functions in case the Soviets tried to jam radio communications between ground control in Houston and US spaceships, and because Apollo was originally conceived to go deeper into the solar system.All of this required a software ""architecture,"" much of which was designed by engineer Hal Laning.Real-time inputReal-time inputIt also needed new ways for man to interact with machine that went beyond the punch-card programming of the time.The engineers came up with three key ways: the switches that you still find in modern cockpits, a hand-controller that was connected to the world's first digital fly-by-wire system, and a ""display and keyboard"" unit, abbreviated DSKY (pronounced ""dis-key"").The astronauts would input two-digit codes for verbs and nouns, to carry out commands like firing thrusters, or locking on to a particular star if the ship, which relied on an inertial guidance system to keep its pitch, roll and yaw stable, had begun to drift off course.O'Brien used the metaphor of a tourist who visits the US and is hungry but doesn't know much English, and might say ""Eat pizza"" to convey the basic meaning.

The underlying process at work is referred to as episodic simulation, essentially the ability of individuals to re-organize memories from the past into a newly-imagined event simulated in the mind.Neuroimaging helped the researchers identify multiple neural pathways that explain the relationship between imagination and the willingness to help others, researchers from Boston College and the University of Albany, SUNY, reported recently in the journal Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience.neural pathwaysSocial Cognitive and Affective NeuroscienceThe team explored two separate brain regions with different functions: the right temporoparietal junction (RTPJ), a key brain region thought to be involved in representing the minds of other people, also known as ""perspective-taking""; and the medial temporal lobe (MTL) subsystem, a set of brain regions that support the simulation of imagined scenes.The study discovered evidence for the direct impact of scene imagery on willingness to help, according to Boston College Associate Professor of Psychology Liane Young, a co-author and the principal investigator on the project. While study participants imagined helping scenes, neural activity in MTL predicted overall willingness to help the person in need, according to the article, ""A role for the medial temporal lobe subsystem in guiding prosociality: the effect of episodic processes on willingness to help others,"" which was published in the journal's April 14 edition.study participants""If we are able to vividly imagine helping someone, then we think we're more likely to actually do it,"" said Young, director of the Morality Lab at BC. ""Imagining the scenery surrounding the situation can also prompt people to take the perspective of the people in the situation who need help, which in turn prompts prosocial action.""This may be because of a phenomenon known as imagination inflation, where humans use the vividness of their imagination as a kind of cue to estimate the likelihood of an event, according to the co-authors, which also included former BC postdoctoral researcher Brendan Gaesser, now an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Albany, SUNY, research assistants Joshua Hirschfeld-Kroen and Emily A. Wasserman, and undergraduate research assistant Mary Horn.The team set out to learn how the capacity to simulate imagined and remembered scenes of helping motivate individuals to form more altruistic intentions. The goal was to uncover the cognitive and neural mechanisms that explain the relationship between episodic simulation and the enhanced willingness to help those in need. In the first experiment, which allowed the team to look at both brain regions, the researchers collected functional brain images as people imagined and remembered helping others in hypothetical scenarios. In the second experiment, while people were imagining helping another person, the team used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to disrupt activity in their right temporoparietal junction (RTPJ), a key brain region thought to be involved in representing the minds of other people.Neuroimaging revealed that the willingness to help was also predicted by activity in the RTPJ, a critical node that's involved in taking the perspective of other people, according to the researchers. However, in the second experiment, when the team used TMS to temporarily inhibit activity in the RTPJ, they found that the altruistic effect of vividly imagining helping remained significant, suggesting that this effect doesn't depend exclusively on perspective-taking.""We had initially expected that higher neural activity in the medial temporal lobe subsystem would be associated with a greater willingness to help,"" the team reported. ""Surprisingly, we found the opposite: the more activity a person had in their MTL subsystem while they were imagining helping scenes, the less willing they were to help the person in need.""neural activitymedial temporal lobeThis contradiction may be explained by lower MTL activity reflecting greater ease of imagining episodes, and that ease of imagination means that participants are more willing to help. Consistent with this account, the team found that when participants reported finding it easier to imagine or remember helping episodes, they also tended to report being more willing to help the person in need.Young and Gaesser recently found in a separate study, led by BC postdoctoral researcher Jaclyn Ford and Professor Elizabeth Kensinger, that vividly remembering helping was associated with making more generous donations in the wake of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. Next steps in the research will further connect the lab's neuroimaging approach with measures of real-world altruistic behavior.

Academy of Management JournalThe Oscars, the Grammys, and even the Nobel Prize, all peer-judged competitions, are often criticised for the decisions of their jurors; some people go as far as making accusations of bias, partisanship and even cronyism.In 2010, Quentin Tarantino was infamously accused of favouritism after he led a Venice Film Festival jury which awarded the prize for Best Picture to his former partner, created a new lifetime-achievement award for his mentor Monte Hellman and graced a long-time friend with two prizes, one of which was the award for Best Director.juryawardDefending himself to an outraged Italian press, Tarantino claimed that ""a friend on a jury is your worst enemy as they would be too embarrassed to give you a prize""—a lesson he said Mr Hellman taught him in 1992.The paradox so aptly defined in Tarantino's statement to the press led researchers, Simone Ferriani from Cass Business School, Erik Aadland from BI Norwegian Business School and Gino Cattani from New York University Stern School, to question how social relationships affect reward allocation choices in peer-based evaluative settings.Combining statistical analysis of eight years' of decision making data from the most prestigious Norwegian advertising industry competition with industry member interviews, researchers sought to understand how relationships between jurors and entrants affect competition results.Three relationship dynamics were used to understand how jurors' decisions are influenced.Direct ties the extent to which jury members tend to favour candidates with whom they have worked in the past.Direct tiesReciprocity the extent to which jury members tend to favour candidates from whom they have themselves been favoured in the past.ReciprocityCliquishness the extent to which jury members tend to favour candidates who are part of the same network clique as the jury members.CliquishnessThe researchers, found that while all three dynamics can improve a candidate's chance of receiving an honourable mention, only reciprocity boosts their chances of being the victor.""Having a direct tie to, or being a part of the same clique as, an award juror can help candidates be shortlisted or nominated but then actually prevent them winning,"" Dr. Ferriani said.""This, we believe, is because people in charge of granting prestigious honors may be driven by self-serving relational interests, as much as the genuine desire to signal their moral integrity and deflect potential inauthenticity concerns away.""Because awards are tremendous drivers of value—film festival awards may increase box office sales, literary prizes can open doors to exclusive publishers and academic awards may secure more research grants—understanding how relationships influence the way they are allocated is particularly important, especially amidst calls for transparency in public life.""These findings should invite some healthy cynicism among those who still have unconditional faith in the universalistic principles that are supposed to inspire meritocratic institutions, but should also come as hopeful news to those who have long lost that faith.""The paper 'Friends, Gifts, and Cliques: Social Proximity and Recognition in Peer-Based Tournament Rituals' is published in the Academy of Management Journal.

Genetics-inspired approach could improve classroom analysis,https://phys.org/news/2019-07-genetics-inspired-approach-classroom-analysis.html,https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/csz/news/325u/2019/geneticsinsp.jpg,Other Sciences,"July 12, 2019","To understand the disparity between the fields of education research and genomics, just consider how each might define the word ""coding.""                                               To Nebraska's Marilyne Stains, whose research on STEM education recently earned her the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers, it means classifying the classroom behavior of instructors and students.classroomTo Robert Erdmann, who earned his doctorate studying plant genetics before joining Stains' lab, it describes how organisms store the biological instruction manuals that make life possible.But Stains brought Erdmann aboard precisely because his academic background differed from her own, prizing the chance to add a distinct perspective and voice to her lab. That investment in the interdisciplinary has paid off in the form of Classroom as Genome, a genetics-inspired approach that the duo developed to better analyze and interpret the data collected from classrooms.The statistical and visualization tools that have accelerated the search for genetic indicators of disease or fitness in organisms have the potential to do the same for STEM education, the researchers said.visualization tools""I think the big innovation here is (being) able to leverage tools that are already vetted and existing in completely different fields and apply them to education data,"" Stains, an associate professor of chemistry, said. ""The tools that we are using here help us identify patterns of instructor (and) student behavior that we really could not do with just traditional statistics.""In comparing notes while brainstorming the approach, Stains and Erdmann identified a few critical but easily overlooked similarities between genomes and classrooms.The duo realized, for instance, that both feature multiple layers of information which can get lost or compressed when looking only at the whole. Collectively, a genome can be thought of as the entire catalog of genetic blueprints in an organism. Understanding the genome on a practical level, though, means digging into the deeper layers: what DNA and genes actually are, how the instructions embedded in genes get transcribed and translated, why that process sometimes fails.Most traditional approaches to analyzing classroom data resemble the former more than the latter, the researchers said, missing dynamics that sometimes best capture how instructors teach and students learn. Stains and Erdmann wanted the nuances. They wanted an approach that could account for both the influence of sequence—how one element might cause or affect the next—and the interplay among events that occur simultaneously or overlap in time. And they wanted to discern meaningful patterns from massive amounts of data gathered from hundreds or even thousands of classrooms.Geneticists have faced similar yet even greater challenges while studying the genomes of organisms, many of which contain millions if not billions of nucleotide bases—the four ""letters"" of DNA's alphabet. The technology-driven rise of bioinformatics over the past few decades has allowed geneticists to interpret the equivalents of words, pages and chapters in the instruction manuals formed by that code—along with the syntax, punctuation and other rules that determine how it gets transcribed.In Erdmann's mind, that staggering progress also represented unrealized potential.""What I was seeing was an opportunity to use those same bioinformatics tools that I used for plant biology for a kind of unique and creative purpose: to analyze data that actually has a lot of parallels with biological data but hadn't been viewed in that context before,"" said Erdmann, now at the University of Minnesota Rochester. ""I think we were both very pleased with how seamlessly it ended up being in terms of using those and the results we were able to get as we tested the tools.""Ahead of the classAhead of the classA major advantage of the Classroom as Genome approach, Stains and Erdmann said, is that it can incorporate multiple ways of measuring the same classroom observations. One common instrument, known as COPUS, helps categorize the presence or absence of behaviors and interactions in the classroom. Other instruments classify the perceived quality or other aspects of those events.Education researchers typically analyze data from different instruments independently of one another, Stains said. But the new approach will allow researchers to layer the presence, quantity and quality of a practice or interaction into one visualization tool, giving them a more comprehensive but still comprehensible view of an instructor's style or classroom culture, she said.""Classrooms are chaotic places,"" Erdmann said. ""You want to be able to get as much as information as you can and not lose any of it. This is a great data structure to use for that.""This lets researchers use the best parts of multiple tools simultaneously to get more information out of the same set of data.""To illustrate the use and value of Classroom as Genome, Stains and Erdmann included examples and case studies—the latter with data from a 2015 paper—when unveiling their approach in the journal CBE—Life Sciences Education.case studiesTheir examples consisted of questions that education researchers might better address using the approach, alongside the genomic equivalents already being answered via bioinformatics. One classroom question looking into how evenly dispersed clicker questions are across a period of instruction was paired with how far a genetic code is from other instances of the same code in a genome.In a related case study, the duo used COPUS data and a genomics visualization tool to test the hypothesis that instructors issuing clicker questions also encourage students to collaborate before answering. Stains and Erdmann then expanded the analysis to demonstrate the breadth of related questions or hypotheses the approach could address.""I think that will be particularly useful for education researchers or others who don't know anything about these techniques,"" Stains said. ""If you use bioinformatics already, the language and the ways of thinking are probably common. But especially for folks who are outside that world, it was really important to demonstrate what these tools look like (and) what they can do.""It's kind of a proof-of-concept to see the potential that these methods have. But I think this is so new that we have to exemplify it.""Stains and Erdmann said they hope the inverse will also prove true—that bench scientists who are more familiar with analyses in the lab than the classroom will come to appreciate and potentially use the latter.""This could be a great bridge between folks in academic departments who are on the more biological end and folks who are thinking more along the educational lines,"" Erdmann said. ""If you provide opportunities for their worlds to collide, it can be very useful for both sides in terms of thinking about education in new ways and helping to make education research something that more people are thinking about.""

Journal of Neuroscience""We currently live in a rapidly aging society,"" said the study's corresponding author, Associate Professor Juan Helen Zhou, a neuroscientist from the faculty of Duke-NUS' Neuroscience and Behavioural Disorders program. ""Compared to cross-sectional studies, it is vital to understand brain changes over time that underlie both healthy and pathologic aging, in order to inform efforts to slow down cognitive aging.""The human brain contains functionally segregated neuronal networks with dense internal connections and sparse inter-connectivity. aging is thought to be associated with reduced functional specialisation and segregation of these brain networks. human brainJoint senior authors Associate Professor Zhou and Professor Michael Chee, Director of Duke-NUS' Centre for Cognitive Neuroscience, led the research team, collecting data from neuropsychological assessments and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain scans from a cohort of 57 healthy young adults and 72 healthy elderly Singaporeans. Each elderly participant was scanned two to three times during a period of up to four years. The neuropsychological assessments tested participants' ability to process information quickly, focus their attention, remember verbal and visuospatial information, and plan and execute tasks. The fMRI scans measured how brain regions are functionally connected based on low-frequency blood oxygenation level fluctuations over time. Participants were asked to relax with their eyes open and remain still as these were performed. functional magnetic resonanceDr. Joanna Chong, first author of the paper and a Ph.D. graduate from Associate Professor Zhou's lab at Duke-NUS, developed approaches to convert the fMRI images into graphic representations that depict the inter- and intra-network connectedness of each individual's brain. She then compared differences in brain functional networks between the young and elderly participants, and in the elderly over time. networkThe team tracked changes in brain functional networks that affected specific cognitive abilities, such as goal-oriented thought and action, and choosing where to focus attention. As one ages, these networks associated with cognition are less efficient in information transfer, more vulnerable to disturbance, and less distinctive. ""Overall, our research advances understanding of brain network changes over time, underlying cognitive decline in healthy aging,"" said Associate Professor Zhou. ""This can facilitate future work to identify elderly individuals at risk of aging-related disorders or to identify strategies that can preserve cognitive function.""Commenting on the study, Professor Patrick Casey, senior vice dean for research at Duke-NUS, stated, ""aging is a significant risk factor for a variety of chronic diseases in people, including neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases. Governments worldwide are concerned about the public health implications of increasingly aging populations. Basic research such as this plays a vital role in informing efforts to help us stay healthy longer as we live longer lives.""The researchers aim to next examine how various factors, such as genetic and cardiovascular risks, might influence aging-related changes in brain networks. By studying a larger group of healthy young, middle-aged and older adults, they hope to develop better ways to predict cognitive decline.                                                                                                                        brain"

Just five days before the 50th anniversary of man's first lunar landing, Chandrayaan-2—or Moon Chariot 2—will blast off from a tropical island off Andhra Pradesh state after a decade-long build-up.The mission will also highlight how far space travel has advanced since Neil Armstrong's giant leap for mankind during the Apollo 11 mission.India has spent about $140 million to get Chandrayaan-2 ready for the 384,400 kilometres (around 240,000 miles) trip from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre to the scheduled landing on the lunar South Pole on September 6.The United States spent about $25 billion—the equivalent of more than $100 billion in current prices—on 15 Apollo missions, including the six that put Armstrong and other astronauts on the Moon. China landed its Chang'e 4 lunar craft in January, and spent $8.4 billion on its entire space programme in 2017, according to international Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development figures.And Russia—the first country to land an unmanned Moon rocket in 1966—spent more than $20 billion at today's values on lunar missions in the 1960s and 70s.Spiced-up space raceSpiced-up space raceAlmost the entire Chandrayaan-2's orbiter, lander and rover have been designed and made in India.India will use its most powerful rocket launcher, GSLV Mk III, to carry the 2.4 tonne orbiter, which has a mission life of about a year.The spacecraft will carry the 1.4 tonne lander Vikram—which in turn will take the 27-kilogramme (60-pound) rover Pragyan—to a high plain between two craters on the lunar South Pole.

In modern times, the monument has become famous the world over, and attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists every year. The researchers explored what a human voice would have sounded like inside the monument during its heyday. To find out, they applied a modern technique that has been used to help architects build concert halls with optimal sound characteristics. The technique involves building a small-scale model of a building prior to construction and blasting sounds at it at 12 times their normal frequency in a sound chamber to overcome the size differences.modern timeshuman voiceconcert hallssoundTo replicate the technique for Stonehenge, the researchers 3-D printed each of the stones and used them to make silicon molds that were then filled with a plaster-polymer mix. Each of the stones was painted and then placed in its original position within the monument. The result was a 1:12 scale model of the original monument—the tallest model stone was just 60 centimeters.Next, the team subjected the model to sound tests in a sound chamber, producing a sound profile for the monument. They then applied the sound profile to the recorded voice of a team member. The researchers claim the voice in the recording sounds like it would have were the team member to have stood in the center of the monument while speaking all those years ago. They note that despite large spaces between the stones, a person's voice would have reverberated around the monument, producing an echoing effect. They also suggest it is not likely that the people who built the monument knew what impact it would have on a speaker's voice, but point out that it seems likely they would have taken advantage of the impressive acoustics.monument                                                © 2019 Science X Network                                            "

William Baldwin, professor and graduate program coordinator in the College of Science's department of biological sciences, and members of his laboratory used a novel mouse model developed in their laboratory to study the role of the Cyp2b gene in obesity. Cyp2b is a key enzyme involved in metabolism, particularly in the detoxification of chemicals in the body. Among other results, the research indicates a role for Cyp2b in unsaturated fatty acid metabolism, regardless of diet. Certain chemicals could inhibit Cyp2b, a phenomenon modeled by Cyp2b-null mice.obesitydietmiceThe study titled ""Cyp2b-null male mice are susceptible to diet-induced obesity and perturbations in lipid homeostasis"" was published in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry. It is part of a three-year, $362,000 grant Baldwin received from the National Institutes of Health to continue studies on how exposure to chemicals is likely to inhibit our bodies' internal mechanisms.

""In turn, maybe your likelihood of retaining white adipose tissue increases and therefore your likelihood of being obese increases.""In addition, male Cyp2b-null mice had increased fatty liver disease without being fed a high-fat diet.""Cyp2b must be signaling something and telling the fat to go someplace, indicating that Cyp2b has dual roles: metabolizing toxicants and chemicals in the environment and pharmaceuticals, but it is also involved in metabolism of lipids and probably involved in signaling to tell us how to distribute fat,"" Baldwin said.With 40 percent of adults and 18.5 percent of youth in the United States now considered obese, the discovery that enzymes associated with detoxification may play a role in obesity—beyond the compounding effects of diet, exercise and general genetics—is critical.Female Cyp2b-null mice did not show any greater propensity toward obesity, though there were indications that they have a higher rate of liver damage than wild-type female mice.Gene expression was also affected.

In their paper published in the journal Science, the group describes how they created the images and what they saw.                                               ScienceScientists have known for some time that molecules change when they are charged, both in function and structure. But until now, they have not been able to see it in action. In this new effort, the researchers have made images of four molecules—azobenzene, pentacene, TCNQ and porphine—as they underwent changes due to charging. They note that molecular charging is at the very heart of many very important biological processes, such as energy transport and photoconversion—thus, observing what it looks like when it happens is very important.imagesTo create the images, the researchers placed a single molecule on an isolated NaCl film and then used high-resolution atomic force microscopy in a very cold vacuum environment to transfer a single electron from the probe tip to the molecule. Imaging was carried out using carbon monoxide-functionalized tips. Each of the molecules was imaged in four states: positive, neutral, negative and double-negative (adding two electrons).single moleculeThe researchers observed structural changes in all of the molecules, and that each was changed in a different way than the others. With pentacene, for example, the team saw which areas of the molecule became more reactive. With TCNQ, they observed changes in the bonds between the atoms in the molecule—and they also noted that it moved relative to its base. And with porphine, they observed changes to the types of bonds and their lengths. They also noted that porphine, in particular, plays a critical role in biological processing—it is involved in the process of hemoglobin transporting oxygen in living organisms. Being able to see what happens to a molecule as it is charged can help to better understand how the whole transport process works. The team further suggests that using techniques such as imaging molecular charge states will help with the development of new materials and devices—and will improve our understanding of nature in general.molecules                                                © 2019 Science X Network                                            "
Research team finds new adaptive trick used by Staphylococcus bacteria,https://phys.org/news/2019-07-team-staphylococcus-bacteria.html,https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/csz/news/325u/2019/7-researchteam.jpg,Biology,"July 12, 2019","In recently published research into the regulatory mechanisms of a disease bacterium often found in the human body, Ohio University Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine Associate Professor of Bacteriology Erin Murphy, Ph.D., and her team didn't find what they went looking for. What they did find, however, opens more research pathways, suggesting science has more to learn about the tools different bacterial pathogens use to adapt to changes in their environment.                                               Murphy is a member of both the Infectious and Tropical Disease Institute and Ohio's interdisciplinary Molecular and Cellular Biology Program (MCB). She and her research team—including collaborators from Ohio University, Egypt and Germany—were trying to identify a temperature-sensitive mechanism that regulates gene expression in Staphylococcus aureus. This is the well-known bacterium many people carry in their nostrils that sometimes penetrates further into the body, causing harmful infections.Staphylococcus aureusAs S. aureus moves from the nose to inside the body, its surroundings get warmer. In some bacteria, such a temperature increase triggers changes in gene expression that may better equip the germ to survive in its new environment—which is bad health news for the human whose body the staph has invaded.S. aureusLooking for a genetic thermometerLooking for a genetic thermometerTemperature-sensing regulators called ""RNA thermometers,"" found in the structure of the messenger RNA molecule (which transmits genetic information from DNA), have been discovered in other bacteria. For instance, Murphy and her collaborators have identified such a mechanism in the Shigella bacterium.They set out to find something similar in S. aureus. Instead, they found a mechanism that responds to temperature changes in the opposite way to RNA thermometers previously encountered—instead of increasing expression of a gene as temperature goes up, this mechanism increased expression as temperature drops. The gene in this case controls production of a protein called CidA.S. aureustemperature changes""What we were looking for was a traditional thermometer,"" Murphy explained. ""Those mediate increased expression of the gene at increased temperature. But here we found decreased expression of our targeted gene. So it's temperature-regulated, but it's expressed less at 37 (degrees Celsius) as compared to lower temperatures."" (When staph moves from the nostrils to inside the body, the temperature increases from about 30 degrees to about 37.)staph This is only the second such RNA ""thermosensor""—one responding to drops rather than rises in temperature—ever found in a bacterial organism, and the first one found in Staphylococcus. This provides a clue that bacterial pathogens have a wider range of adaptive tools than previously realized.As Murphy and her co-authors put it in a paper published in the journal Plos One : ""In addition to the characterization of the first RNA-based thermosensor in the significant pathogen S. aureus, (this finding) highlights the diversity of function within this important class of ribo-regulators.""Plos OneS. aureusMight we turn off S. aureus' thermostat?Might we turn off S. aureus' thermostat?Understanding temperature-responsive regulation of bacterial gene expression raises the possibility that down the line, a drug might be found to lock the thermosensor into its low-temperature setting. If this could be done, it would mean that when S. aureus moved from the nose to warmer places inside the body, the change in temperature would not trigger a change in gene expression, and the bacterium would not benefit from whatever survival advantage that change normally provides.S. aureusgene expression""This mechanism of regulation is quite amenable to being manipulated,"" said Ronan Carroll, Ph.D., Ohio assistant professor of microbiology in the biological sciences department, faculty member at the Infectious and Tropical Disease Institute and MCB, and a co-author on the paper. ""About 33 percent of the population has staph in its nose. It doesn't do you any harm, but it's well known that it can go from your nose into your body and cause infections. And so if we could develop a molecule that could lock an RNA thermosensor in one format, you could imagine that you could use that as a therapy. Now, that's a very, very long way down the road from where we are now, but you've got to have goals, right?""Dr. Carroll noted that one requirement for achieving this goal would be a much better understanding of the benefits CidA confers to S. aureus, which currently are unclear. ""No one really fully understands what it does,"" he said.S. aureusFinding a tool other than antibiotics to attack S. aureus is a pressing medical problem. Antimicrobial resistance or AMR—essentially, the phenomenon in which bacterial pathogens rapidly evolve genetic resistance to commonly used antibiotics—is increasingly recognized as a serious public health threat. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is widespread, with many staph infections now proving resistant to the antibiotic methicillin.S. aureusS. aureusThe value of serendipityThe value of serendipityMurphy's research also confirms that in science, studies that give unexpected results can be valuable. Murphy and her collaborators expected to find a classic RNA thermometer in S. aureus ; what they found was significantly different—but interesting. Murphy and her team had provided a computerized version of the S. aureus genome to a researcher at Ruhr University in Bochum, Germany, who designed a computer program to search the genome for likely RNA thermometer sites, based on structural features often seen at such sites. More than 270 possible RNA thermometers were identified, but few have panned out to date. And when Murphy's team in Athens tested these sites for regulatory changes at different temperatures, they found the unexpected low-temperature correlation.S. aureusS. aureus""One of my students, Hebaallaha Hussein, came to me initially with the data,"" Murphy recalled. Hussein, a visiting scholar from Egypt, is the primary author on the recently published paper. ""She was basically saying, ""Oh, it's not working; it's not what we thought; there must be something wrong,"""" Murphy said. ""And we said, ""Actually, the data is good data. So what does it mean?"" It allowed us then to go down an unexpected path. I think there is definitely more to learn about RNA thermosensors and how bacteria respond using RNA than we currently understand. We often kind of get into a rut of thinking we know about this already. But clearly there are differences that we didn't know about.""Darlene Berryman, Ph.D., R.D., L.D., associate dean for research and innovation at the Heritage College, called the study an indicator of the college's growing research ambitions. ""This research highlights the expanded, collaborative efforts of the Heritage College's Infectious and Tropical Disease Institute in the area of bacterial pathogenesis,"" she said. ""These unexpected findings also illustrate that we still have a lot to learn about our microbial environment.

The findings, now published in Nature Communications, paves the way towards new treatments for certain neurological disorders.Nature CommunicationsThe research focuses on KIF1C: a tiny protein-based molecular motor that moves along microscopic tubular tracks (called microtubules) within neurons. The motor converts chemical energy into mechanical energy used to transport various cargoes along microtubule tracks, which is necessary for maintaining proper neurological function.neuronschemical energymechanical energyNeurons are cells that form the basis of our nervous system, conducting the vital function of transferring signals between the brain, the spinal cord and the rest of the body. They consist of a soma, dendrites, and an axon, a long projection from the cell that transports signals to other neurons.Molecular motors need to be inactive and park until their cargo is loaded onto them. Neurons are an unusually long (up to 3 feet) type of nerve cell, and because of this marathon distance, these tiny molecular motors need to keep going until their cargo is delivered at the end.Insufficient cargo transport is a crucial cause for some debilitating neurological disorders. Faulty KIF1C molecular motors cause hereditary spastic paraplegia, which affects an estimated 135,000 people worldwide. Other studies have also found links between defective molecular motors and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia.The research shows how, when not loaded with cargo, KIF1C prevents itself from attaching to microtubule tracks by folding on to itself. The scientists also identified two proteins: PTNPN21 and Hook3, which can attach to the KIF1C molecular motor. These proteins unfold KIF1C, activating it and allowing the motor to attach and run along the microtubule tracks—like firing the starting pistol for the marathon race.molecular motorThe newly identified activators of KIF1C may stimulate cargo transport within the defective nerve cells of patients with hereditary spastic paraplegia, a possibility the team is currently exploring.cellshereditary spastic paraplegiaCommenting on the future impact of this research, Dr. Anne Straube from Warwick Medical School said: ""If we understand how motors are shut off and on, we may be able to design cellular transport machines with altered properties. These could potentially be transferred into patients with defect cellular transport to compensate for the defects. Alternatively they can be used for nanotechnology to build new materials by exploiting their ability to concentrate enzymes or chemical reagents. We are also studying the properties of the motors with patient mutations to understand why they function less well.transport""We still know very little about how motors are regulated. There are 45 kinesins expressed in human cells, but we only have an idea how the motors are activated for less than a handful of them. KIF1C is the fastest motor in neurons and the motor that is the most versatile—it delivers cargoes efficiently to all processes in a neuron, not just the axon.""                                                                                                                        human cells"
How multicellular cyanobacteria transport molecules,https://phys.org/news/2019-07-multicellular-cyanobacteria-molecules.html,https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/csz/news/325u/2019/howmulticell.jpg,Biology,"July 12, 2019","Researchers from ETH Zurich and the University of Tübingen have taken a high-resolution look at the structure and function of cell-to-cell connections in filamentous, multicellular cyanobacteria. This enables them to explain how these microorganisms regulate the transport of various substances between the individual cells.                                               Also known as blue-green algae, cyanobacteria are a special class of bacteria that are able to perform photosynthesis. In evolutionary terms, they are ancient. Their predecessors—which first emerged on earth some 2.5 billion years ago—paved the way for higher forms of life thanks to their ability to produce oxygen by photosynthesis.blue-green algaecyanobacteriaSome cyanobacterial species are filamentous, multicellular organisms that have developed differentiated cell functions. Some cells perform photosynthesis, while others absorb atmospheric nitrogen. The cyanobacteria obtain energy in the form of glucose through photosynthesis; they use the nitrogen to produce amino acids, the building blocks of proteins.cell functionscellsFor the cyanobacteria, this poses the problem of how the individual cells can communicate and exchange substances. The photosynthetic cells have to keep their nitrogen-fixing sister cells supplied with glucose; by the same token, amino acids need to be transported in the opposite direction. To this end, cyanobacteria have developed special cell junctions that permit the exchange of nutrients and messengers across cell boundaries, without the cells being fused together.individual cellsElucidating the structure in cellular contextElucidating the structure in cellular contextTo date, very little was known about the detailed structure and precise functioning of the cell junctions in multicellular, filamentous cyanobacteria. In the latest issue of the scientific journal Cell, a group of researchers from ETH Zurich and the University of Tübingen presents an unprecedented degree of detail on the structure and function of the cell-to-cell connections, referred to as septal junctions, in the Anabaena genus.CellThe researchers reveal that the connecting channels are composed of a protein tube that is sealed with a plug at both ends. Moreover, this tube is covered with five-armed protein elements, which are arranged much like a camera aperture.The channels connect the cytoplasms of two neighbouring cells by passing through the different membranes and cell walls. The cells are separated by an ultra-thin gap, just a few nanometres wide.""Researchers have so far failed to clarify these details with conventional electron microscopy. By extending cryo-electron microscopy, we were able to gain a degree of precision never before achieved,"" says Professor Martin Pilhofer from the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biophysics at ETH Zurich.Gregor Weiss, Pilhofer's doctoral student, developed a process of preparing the cyanobacteria in such a way that the channels could be visualised via cryo-electron microscopy. Using frozen cyanobacteria, Weiss ""milled"" the junction between two cells, layer by layer, until his sample was thin enough. Without this pre-processing, the spherical cells would have been too thick for cryo-electron microscopy.Mechanism to prevent leakingMechanism to prevent leaking""Due to the complex structure of the connecting channels, we suspected there was a mechanism to open and close them,"" said Karl Forchhammer, Professor for Microbiology at the University of Tübingen. He and his team were in fact able to show how the cells of the complex communicate with each other under different stress conditions. They stained cyanobacteria chains with a fluorescent dye and then bleached individual cells with a laser. The researchers then measured the influx of the dye from neighbouring cells.Using this method, they were able to show that the channels actually close when treated with chemicals or in the dark. The filigree cap structure of a channel closes like an iris and interrupts the exchange of substances between the cells; the researchers recognised this phenomenon through the varying degree of fluorescence they observed.""This closing mechanism protects the entire multicellular organism,"" Forchhammer says. For example, it can prevent a cell from passing on harmful substances to its neighbouring cells, which could destroy the whole organism. The cyanobacteria can also use the channels to prevent the cell contents of the entire network from leaking out if individual cells are mechanically damaged.Conserved structuresConserved structuresWith their study, the researchers are able to show that in the course of evolution, multicellular organisms of different lineages repeatedly and independently ""invented"" cell junctions. ""It emphasises just how important it is for a multicellular organism to be able to monitor the transport of substances between its individual cells,"" Pilhofer says. By elucidating the channel structure and function in cyanobacteria, the ETH researchers are adding another piece to the puzzle. ""As far as we are concerned, this is fundamental biological research, without focusing on any potential application. The new data rather gives us a greater understanding of the evolution of complex life forms,"" the ETH professor explains.                                                                                                                        multicellular organismsnew data"

Neurons are known to break down an incoming electrical signal into sub-units. Now, researchers at Blue Brain have discovered that dendrites, the neuron's tree-like receptors, work together—dynamically and depending on the workload—for learning. The findings further our understanding of how we think and may inspire new algorithms for artificial intelligence.                                                In a paper published in the journal Cell Reports, researchers at EPFL's Blue Brain Project, a Swiss Brain Research Initiative, have developed a new framework to work out how a single neuron in the brain operates.Cell ReportsThe analysis was performed using cells from the Blue Brain's virtual rodent cortex. The researchers expect other types of neurons—non-cortical or human—to operate in the same way.Their results show that when a neuron receives input, the branches of the elaborate tree-like receptors extending from the neuron, known as dendrites, functionally work together in a way that is adjusted to the complexity of the input.The strength of a synapse determines how strongly a neuron feels an electric signal coming from other neurons, and the act of learning changes this strength. By analyzing the ""connectivity matrix"" that determines how these synapses communicate with each other, the algorithm establishes when and where synapses group into independent learning units from the structural and electrical properties of dendrites. In other words, the new algorithm determines how the dendrites of neurons functionally break up into separate computing units and finds that they work together dynamically, depending on the workload, to process information.The researchers liken their results to the functioning of computing technology already implemented today. This newly observed dendritic functionality acts like parallel computing units meaning that a neuron is able to process different aspects of the input in parallel, like supercomputers. Each of the parallel computing units can independently learn to adjust its output, much like the nodes in deep learning networks used in artificial intelligence (AI) models today. Comparable to cloud computing, a neuron dynamically breaks up into the number of separate computing units demanded by the workload of the input.""In the Blue Brain Project, this mathematical approach helps to ascertain functionally relevant clusters of neuronal input which are inputs that feed into the same parallel processing unit. This then enables us to determine the level of complexity at which to model cortical networks as we digitally reconstruct and simulate the brain,"" explains Marc-Oliver Gewaltig, Section Manager in Blue Brain's Simulation Neuroscience Division.Parallel computing units of neurons can independently learn to adjust their outputParallel computing units of neurons can independently learn to adjust their outputAdditionally, the research reveals how these parallel processing units influence learning, i.e. the change in connection strength between different neurons. The way a neuron learns depends on the number and location of parallel processors, which in turn depend on the signals arriving from other neurons. For instance, certain synapses that do not learn independently when the neuron's input level is low, start to learn independently when the input levels are higher.To date traditional learning algorithms (such as those currently used in A.I. applications) assume that neurons are static units that merely integrate and re-scale incoming signals. By contrast, the results show that the number and size of the independent subunits can be controlled by balanced input or shunting inhibition. The researchers propose that this temporary control of the compartmentalization constitutes a powerful mechanism for the branch-specific learning of input features.""The method finds that in many brain states, neurons have far fewer parallel processors than expected from dendritic branch patterns. Thus, many synapses appear to be in 'grey zones' where they do not belong to any processing unit,"" explains lead scientist and first author Willem Wybo. ""However, in the brain, neurons receive varying levels of background input and our results show that the number of parallel processors varies with the level of background input, indicating that the same neuron might have different computational roles in different brain states.""neurons""We are particularly excited about this observation since it sheds a new light on the role of up/down states in the brain and it also provides a reason as to why cortical inhibition is so location-specific. With the new insights, we can start looking for algorithms that exploit the rapid changes in pairing between processing units, offering us more insight into the fundamental question of how the brain computes,"" concludes Gewaltig.                                                                                                                        brain"

Primitive ones instead consume dissolved iron ions—which would have been abundant in the oceans of early Earth. They produce rust as a byproduct instead of oxygen.Using experimental microbiology, genomics, and large-scale biogeochemical modeling, ""we found that photosynthetic bacteria that use iron instead of water are fierce competitors for light and nutrients,"" says Ozaki, the paper's first author and now an assistant professor in the Department of Environmental Science at Toho University, in Japan. ""We propose that their ability to outcompete oxygen-producing photosynthesizers is an important component of Earth's global oxygen cycle.""photosynthetic bacteriaThe study is part of Reinhard's research goal to understand how the evolution of the photosynthetic biosphere controlled the composition of Earth's atmosphere. ""We want to understand the timing of major biological innovations and their impact on the chemistry of Earth's oceans and atmosphere.

Previous research indicates that at least some of these should be orbited by large moons.Their absence, the researchers write in a paper soon to be published in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, could be explained by a scenario in which the angular momentum between the two bodies results in the moon escaping the gravitational pull of its parent.Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Societyangular momentummoon""These moons would become planetary embryos, or even fully-fledged planets, with highly eccentric orbits of their own,"" explains Alvarado-Montes.planetsWhile conceding that ploonets remain hypothetical, the researchers say their existence would offer a possible explanation for several challenging results produced by NASA's now-retired Kepler space telescope.possible explanationThese include the puzzling dips in the light-curves emanating from a formally known as KIC-8462852.""It's better known as Tabby Star,"" says Alvarado-Montes, ""and the strange changes in its light intensity have been observed for years, but are still not understood.

A compound of nanostructured SBA-15 silica and HBsAg, the hepatitis B surface antigen, was submitted to different types of X-ray imaging in European laboratories.The nanostructured silica was developed by researchers at the University of São Paulo's Physics Institute (IF-USP) in Brazil. The antigen was created by the Butantan Institute, which is also in São Paulo. The results are published in Scientific Reports.Scientific ReportsThe aim of the study was to understand how a 22-nanometer-sized antigen binds to silica nanotubes with a diameter of approximately 10 nanometers and a honeycomb-like structure. One nanometer (1 nm) is a billionth of a meter. Studies carried out at USP revealed the measurements of both the antigen and the silica nanotubes using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and transmission electron microscope.""Despite the size difference, tests [in animals] produced an excellent immune response to the oral vaccine—as good as the injectable form or better,"" said Márcia Fantini, full professor at IF-USP.oral vaccineX-ray and neutron imaging was coordinated by Heloisa Bordalo, a Brazilian researcher at the University of Copenhagen's Niels Bohr Institute in Denmark. In collaboration with other researchers in Denmark as well as colleagues in France, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland, Bordalo submitted the compound to small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), among other techniques.The three-dimensional images obtained by these techniques showed that although the antigen did not enter the nanotubes, it was retained in 50 nm macropores between the nanotubes. This protected it from the acidity of the digestive system.three-dimensional imagesThe images also enabled the researchers to determine the ideal proportion of silica and HBsAg so that the antigen did not agglomerate, hindering the dispersion of the active principle in the patient's intestine. ""The oral and intranasal routes are natural modes of vaccine administration. Nature is the best vaccination agent.

New CRISPR platform expands RNA editing capabilities,https://phys.org/news/2019-07-crispr-platform-rna-capabilities.html,https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/csz/news/325u/2019/newcrisprpla.jpg,Biology,"July 11, 2019","CRISPR-based tools have revolutionized our ability to target disease-linked genetic mutations. CRISPR technology comprises a growing family of tools that can manipulate genes and their expression, including by targeting DNA with the enzymes Cas9 and Cas12 and targeting RNA with the enzyme Cas13. This collection offers different strategies for tackling mutations. Targeting disease-linked mutations in RNA, which is relatively short-lived, would avoid making permanent changes to the genome. In addition, some cell types, such as neurons, are difficult to edit using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing, and new strategies are needed to treat devastating diseases that affect the brain.                                               McGovern Institute Investigator and Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard core member Feng Zhang and his team have now developed one such strategy, called RESCUE (RNA Editing for Specific C to U Exchange), described in the journal Science.ScienceZhang and his team, including first co-authors Omar Abudayyeh and Jonathan Gootenberg (both now McGovern Fellows), made use of a deactivated Cas13 to guide RESCUE to targeted cytosine bases on RNA transcripts, and used a novel, evolved, programmable enzyme to convert unwanted cytosine into uridine—thereby directing a change in the RNA instructions. RESCUE builds on REPAIR, a technology developed by Zhang's team that changes adenine bases into inosine in RNA.RESCUE significantly expands the landscape that CRISPR tools can target to include modifiable positions in proteins, such as phosphorylation sites for the first time. Such sites act as on/off switches for protein activity and are notably found in signaling molecules and cancer-linked pathways.""To treat the diversity of genetic changes that cause disease, we need an array of precise technologies to choose from. By developing this new enzyme and combining it with the programmability and precision of CRISPR, we were able to fill a critical gap in the toolbox,"" says Zhang, the James and Patricia Poitras Professor of Neuroscience at MIT. Zhang also has appointments in MIT's departments of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and Biological Engineering.Expanding the reach of RNA editing to new targetsExpanding the reach of RNA editing to new targetsThe previously developed REPAIR platform used the RNA-targeting CRISPR/Cas13 to direct the active domain of an RNA editor, ADAR2, to specific RNA transcripts where it could convert the nucleotide base adenine to inosine, or letters A to I. Since no natural editors exist with alternative activities, Zhang and colleagues took the REPAIR fusion, and evolved it in the lab until it could change cytosine to uridine, or C to U.RESCUE can be guided to any RNA of choice, then perform a C-to-U edit through the evolved ADAR2 component of the platform. The team took the new platform into human cells, showing that they could target natural RNAs in the cell as well as 24 clinically relevant mutations in synthetic RNAs. They then further optimized RESCUE to reduce off-target editing, while minimally disrupting on-target editing.New targets in sightNew targets in sightExpanded targeting by RESCUE means that sites regulating activity and function of many proteins through post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, and methylation can now be targeted for editing.A major advantage of RNA editing is its reversibility, in contrast to changes made at the DNA level, which are permanent. Thus, RESCUE could be deployed transiently in situations where a modification may be desirable temporarily, but not permanently. To demonstrate this, the team showed that in human cells, RESCUE can target specific sites in the RNA encoding β-catenin, that are known to be phosphorylated on the protein product, leading to a temporary increase in β-catenin activation and cell growth. If such a change was made permanently, it could predispose cells to uncontrolled cell growth and cancer, but by using RESCUE, transient cell growth could potentially stimulate wound healing in response to acute injuries.human cellsThe researchers also targeted a pathogenic gene variant, APOE4. The APOE4 allele has consistently emerged as a genetic risk factor for the development of late-onset Alzheimer's Disease. Isoform APOE4 differs from APOE2, which is not a risk factor, by just two differences (both C in APOE4 vs. U in APOE2). Zhang and colleagues introduced the risk-associated APOE4 RNA into cells, and showed that RESCUE can convert its signature C's to an APOE2 sequence, essentially converting a risk to a non-risk variant.genetic risk factorTo facilitate additional work that will push RESCUE toward the clinic as well as enable researchers to use RESCUE as a tool to better understand disease-causing mutations, the Zhang lab plans to share the RESCUE system broadly, as they have with previously developed CRISPR tools. The technology will be freely available for academic research through the non-profit plasmid repository Addgene. Additional information can be found on the Zhang lab's webpage.                                                                                                                        "

UV light also breaks oxygen bonds, eventually creating ozone, and cleaves hydrogen off other molecules to leave behind free radicals that can damage tissue.lightmoleculesUniversity of California, Berkeley, chemists using some of the shortest laser pulses available—one quintillionth of a second—have now been able to resolve the step-by-step process leading to the exploding of a chemical bond, essentially making a movie of the event. They can follow electrons indecisively bouncing around in various states in the molecule before the bond breaks, and the atoms go their separate ways.chemicalbondThe technique, reported last week in the journal Science, will help chemists understand and potentially manipulate chemical reactions stimulated by light, so-called photochemical reactions. Chemists and biologists, in particular, are interested in understanding how large molecules manage to absorb light energy without breaking any bonds, as happens when molecules in the eye absorb light, giving us vision, or molecules in plants absorb light for photosynthesis.Sciencechemical reactionslarge moleculeslight energy""Think about a molecule, rhodopsin, in the eye,"" said first author Yuki Kobayashi, a UC Berkeley doctoral student. ""When light hits the retina, rhodopsin absorbs the visible light, and we can see things because rhodopsin's bond's conformation changes.""visible lightIn fact, when the light energy is absorbed, a bond in rhodopsin twists, instead of breaks, triggering other reactions that result in the perception of light. The technique Kobayashi and his UC Berkeley colleagues, professors Stephen Leone and Daniel Neumark, developed could be used to study in detail how this light absorption leads to twisting after the molecule passes through an excited state called an avoided crossing or conical intersection.excited stateTo prevent the breaking of a bond in DNA, ""you want to redirect the energy from dissociation to just being vibrationally hot. For rhodopsin, you want to redirect the energy from vibrating to a cis-trans isomerization, a twist,"" Kobayashi said. ""These redirections of chemical reactions are happening ubiquitously around us, but we have not seen the actual moment of them before.""Fast laser pulsesFast laser pulsesAttosecond lasers—an attosecond is a billionth of a billionth of a second—have been around for about a decade and are used by scientists to probe very fast reactions. Since most chemical reactions occur rapidly, these fast-pulse lasers are key to ""seeing"" how the electrons that form the chemical bond behave when the bond breaks and/or reforms.Leone, a professor of chemistry and of physics, is an experimentalist who also uses theoretical tools and is a pioneer in using attosecond lasers to probe chemical reactions. He has six of these X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (collectively, XUV) lasers in his UC Berkeley laboratory.Working with one of the simplest of molecules, iodine monobromide (IBr)—which is one iodine atom linked to one bromine atom—the UC Berkeley team hit the molecules with an 8 femtosecond pulse of visible light to excite one of their outermost electrons, then probed them with attosecond laser pulses.Pulsing the attosecond XUV laser at timed intervals of 1.5 femtosecond (a femtosecond is 1,000 attoseconds), much like using a strobe light, the researchers could detect the steps leading to the breakup of the molecules. The high-energy XUV laser was able to explore the excited energy states relative to the molecule's inner electrons, which normally do not participate in chemical reactions.""You are kind of making a movie of the pathways of the electron when it approaches the crossing and the probability of it going along one path or along another,"" Leone said. ""These tools we are developing allow you to look at solids, gases and liquids, but you need the shorter time scales (provided by an attosecond laser). Otherwise, you only see the beginning and the end, and you don't know what else happened in between.""laserThe experiment showed clearly that the outer electrons of IBr, once excited, suddenly see a variety of states or places they could be and explore many of them before deciding which path to take. In this simple molecule, however, all paths lead to the electron settling on either iodine or bromine and the two atoms flying apart.In larger molecules, which the team hopes soon to explore, excited electrons would have more choices, some where the energy goes into a twist, like with rhodopsin, or into molecular vibration without the molecules breaking apart.""In biology, it turns out that evolution has selected things that are extremely effective at absorbing the energy and not breaking a bond,"" Leone said. ""When something goes wrong in your chemistry is when you see diseases cropping up.""

""Jupiter and its moons are a little planetary system within our solar system, for example, and it's believed Jupiter's moons formed from a circumplanetary disk when Jupiter was very young.""starsBut most models of planet formation show that circumplanetary disks disappear within about 10 million years, which means circumplanetary disks haven't existed in our solar system for more than 4 billion years. To look for them elsewhere and gather observational evidence to test theories of planet formation, Isella and colleagues search for very young star systems where they can directly observe disks and the planets still forming inside them. In the new study, Isella and colleagues analyzed observations made by ALMA in 2017.planets""There are a handful of candidate planets that have been detected in disks, but this is a very new field, and they are all still debated,"" Isella said. ""(PDS 70 b and PDS 70 c) are among the most robust because there have been independent observations with different instruments and techniques.""PDS 70 is a dwarf star about three-quarters the mass of the sun. Both of its planets are 5-10 times larger than Jupiter, and the innermost, PDS 70 b, orbits about 1.8 billion miles from the star, roughly the distance from the sun to Uranus. PDS 70 c is a billion miles further out, in an orbit about the size of Neptune's.PDS 70 b was first revealed in 2018 in infrared light images from a planet-hunting instrument called SPHERE at the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT). In June, astronomers used another VLT instrument called MUSE to observe a visible wavelength of light known as H-alpha, which is emitted when hydrogen falls onto a star or planet and becomes ionized.""H-alpha gives us more confidence that these are planets because it suggests they are still drawing in gas and dust and growing,"" Isella said.The millimeter wavelength observations from ALMA provide even more evidence.""It's complimentary to the optical data and provides completely independent confirmation that there is something there,"" he said.Isella said direct observation of planets with circumplanetary disks could allow astronomers to test theories of planet formation.""There's much that we don't understand about how planets form, and we now finally have the instruments to make direct observations and begin answering questions about how our solar system formed and how other planets might form.""Isella is an assistant professor of physics and astronomy and of Earth, environmental and planetary sciences at Rice and a co-investigator on the Rice-based, NASA-funded CLEVER Planets project.

It's remarkable that they can now be predicted en masse using the large amounts of genomic sequence data that have been generated in recent years,"" said senior author David Baker, professor of biochemistry at the University of Washington School of Medicine.Cells are packed with proteins, many of which must physically interact in order to function. This can mean coming together to copy DNA or to form long fibers like those found in muscle. In many cases, however, scientists still do not know which proteins interact. Discovering new pairings can be slow, laborious, and costly.Looking for a better way, a team of four computational biologists studied a phenomenon called co-evolution, wherein changes in one gene are associated with changes in another. This can indicate that two genes are linked in some important way.For example, if one gene mutates to produce a protein with an altered shape, a second may evolve to produce a protein with a shape complementary to the first, thereby preserving the ability of the two proteins to interact.In recent years, researchers have found evidence for some of these subtle molecular interactions in an organism's DNA.""Co-evolution has been useful for understanding how specific proteins interact, but we can now use it as a tool for discovery,"" said lead author Qian Cong, a postdoctoral fellow at the UW School of Medicine.The research team compared more than 4,000 genes from E. coli to DNA sequences from more than 40,000 other bacterial genomes. This large stockpile of genetic information allowed the researchers to use a bespoke statistical model to assess co-evolution between each E. coli gene.After several rounds of analysis, 1,618 pairs were found to have the strongest evidence of co-evolution. By comparing their results to a small set of already characterized protein-protein interactions, the researchers achieved considerably higher accuracy than previous experimental screening methods.protein-protein interactionsAmong the newly discovered interactions were a few that hint at new biological insights. One of these, an interaction between a protein toxin and its antitoxin, may help explain, the researchers speculate, why some E. coli dominate their microbial niche. Another newfound pairing suggests that a protein called PstB, which was known to play a role in metabolism, may also help coordinate protein synthesis and mineral transport.""It is rare in biology for a software tool to make predictions that are promising enough to test, but that is exactly what's happening here,"" said Cong. There are literally hundreds of follow-up experiments that could be performed in labs around the world.""software toolThe team also scoured the genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a disease bacterium distantly related to E. coli. They identified 911 protein-protein interactions with high confidence. 95 percent of these had never been previously described. Seventy involve proteins that may contribute to the virulence of M. tuberculosis, the researchers report. These findings may open new routes to develop drugs against the deadly pathogen.""We are going to apply this tool to more pathogens, and the human genome,"" says Cong. ""Our success will depend on how much work other scientists put into annotating which parts of the genome are genes and which parts are something else.""                                                                                                                        human genomegenes"
Alternating currents cause Jupiter's aurora,https://phys.org/news/2019-07-alternating-currents-jupiter-aurora.html,https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/csz/news/325u/2019/jupiter.jpg,Astronomy & Space,"July 11, 2019","An international team of researchers has succeeded in measuring the current system responsible for Jupiter's aurora. Using data transmitted to Earth by NASA's Juno spacecraft, they showed that the direct currents were much weaker than expected and that alternating currents must therefore play a special role. On Earth, on the other hand, a direct current system creates its aurora. Jupiter's electric current system is kept going in particular by large centrifugal forces, which hurl ionized sulfur dioxide gas from the gas giant's moon Io through the magnetosphere.                                               Professor Dr. Joachim Saur from the Institute of Geophysics and Meteorology at the University of Cologne was involved in the project. The article ""Birkeland currents in Jupiter's magnetosphere observed by the polar-orbiting Juno spacecraft"" is published in the current issue of Nature Astronomy.magnetospherecurrentNature AstronomyJupiter, the largest planet in the solar system, has the brightest aurora, with a radiant power of 100 terawatts (100,000,000,000 kilowatts = one hundred billion KW). 100,000 power plants would be needed to produce this light. Similarly to the ones on Earth, Jupiter's aurora display themselves as two huge oval rings around the poles. They are driven by a gigantic system of electrical currents that connects the polar light region with Jupiter's magnetosphere. The magnetosphere is the region around a planet that is influenced by its magnetic field. Most of the electric currents run along Jupiter's magnetic field lines, also known as Birkeland currents.auroraelectric currentsNASA's Juno spacecraft has been in a polar orbit around Jupiter since July 2016. Its goal is to better understand the interior and aurora of Jupiter. Juno has now measured for the first time the electric direct current system responsible for Jupiter's aurora. For this purpose, the scientists measured the magnetic field environment of Jupiter with high precision in order to derive the electric currents. The total current is approximately 50 million amperes. However, this value is clearly below the theoretically expected values. The reason for this deviation are small-scale, turbulent alternating currents (also referred to as Alfvenic currents), which have so far received little attention. ""These observations, combined with other Juno spacecraft measurements, show that alternating currents play a much greater role in generating Jupiter's aurora than the direct current system,"" Joachim Saur said. He has been doing research on these turbulent alternating currents for 15 years, stressing their importance. Jupiter's aurora differ from those on Earth, which are essentially generated by direct currents. The Earth's northern lights shine about a thousand times weaker because the Earth is smaller than Jupiter, has a weaker magnetic field and rotates more slowly.""Jupiter's electric current systems are driven by the enormous centrifugal forces in Jupiter's rapidly rotating magnetosphere,"" Saur remarked. The volcanically active Jupiter moon Io produces one ton of sulfur dioxide gas per second, which ionizes into Jupiter's magnetosphere. ""Because of Jupiter's fast rotation—a day on Jupiter lasts only ten hours—the centrifugal forces move the ionized gas in Jupiter's magnetic field, which generate the electric currents,"" the geophysicist concludes.                                                                                                                        sulfur dioxide gasmagnetic field"

In a new study published July 12 in the journal Science, the researchers describe their latest advance, called sheath-run artificial muscles, or SRAMs.Scienceartificial musclesThe research group's previous muscles were made by twisting CNT yarn, polymer fishing line or nylon sewing thread. By twisting these fibers to the point that they coil, the researchers produced muscles that dramatically contract, or actuate, along their length when heated and return to their initial length when cooled.To form the new muscles, the research team applied a polymer coating to twisted CNT yarns, as well as to inexpensive nylon, silk and bamboo yarns, creating a sheath around the yarn core.""In our new muscles, it is the sheath around a coiled or twisted yarn that drives actuation and provides much higher work-per-cycle and power densities than for our previous muscles,"" said Dr. Ray Baughman, corresponding author of the study, the Robert A. Welch Distinguished Chair in Chemistry and director of the Alan G. MacDiarmid NanoTech Institute at UT Dallas.In their experiments, a key step to making the finished muscles was to twist the newly coated yarns until they coil, while the sheath material was still wet.""If you insert twisting or coiling after the sheath has dried, the sheath will crack,"" Baughman said. ""Optimizing the thickness of the sheath is also very important. If it is too thick, the twisted yarn at the core won't be able to untwist because the sheath is holding it in place. If it is too thin, the untwisting of the yarn will cause the sheath to crack.""Dr. Jiuke Mu, lead author of the study and a research scientist with the NanoTech Institute, first developed the concept of the sheath-run artificial muscle. In the sheath-run configuration, the outside sheath absorbs energy and drives the actuation of the muscle.muscle""In our previous twisted and coiled muscles, we applied thermal energy to the entire muscle, but only the outer, twisted part of the fiber was doing any mechanical work—the central part was doing little,"" Mu said. ""Using the sheath, the input energy can be converted into the mechanical energy of the muscle more quickly and efficiently.thermal energymechanical work""Why consume energy by heating the whole yarn, when all you need is to heat the outer part of the yarn for it to actuate?"" Mu said. ""With our new muscles, we only have to put energy into the sheath.""Baughman said many materials could be used for the sheath, as long as they have strength and can undergo dimensional change under various ambient variables, such as changes in temperature or moisture.When operated electrochemically, a muscle consisting of a CNT sheath and a nylon core generated an average contractile power that is 40 times that of human muscle and 9 times that of the highest power alternative electrochemical muscle.""In our previous work, we showed that yarns made from carbon nanotubes make wonderful artificial muscles. Such yarns are lightweight, yet are stronger and more powerful than human muscles of the same length and weight,"" Baughman said.""But carbon nanotube yarn is very expensive, so in this new work, we're going in a different direction,"" he said. ""We found that while we can use carbon nanotubes as the core material for sheath-run artificial muscles, we don't have to. We demonstrated that CNT yarns can be replaced by inexpensive, commercially available yarns.""yarnHe added that the polymer coating process could easily be scaled up for commercial production.""Since the SRAM technology enables the replacement of CNT yarns with cheaper yarns, these muscles are very attractive for intelligent structures, such as robotics and comfort-adjusting clothing,"" Baughman said.To demonstrate possible consumer applications of sheath-run artificial muscles, the researchers knitted SRAMs into a textile that increased porosity when exposed to moisture. They also demonstrated an SRAM made from polymer-coated nylon thread that linearly contracts when exposed to increasing glucose concentration. This muscle might be used to squeeze a pouch to release medication to counteract high blood sugar.

Hubble discovers mysterious black hole disc,https://phys.org/news/2019-07-hubble-mysterious-black-hole-disc.html,https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/csz/news/325u/2019/hubblediscov.jpg,Astronomy & Space,"July 11, 2019","Astronomers using the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope have observed an unexpected thin disc of material encircling a supermassive black hole at the heart of the spiral galaxy NGC 3147, located 130 million light-years away.                                               The presence of the black hole disc in such a low-luminosity active galaxy has astronomers surprised. Black holes in certain types of galaxies such as NGC 3147 are considered to be starving as there is insufficient gravitationally captured material to feed them regularly. It is therefore puzzling that there is a thin disc encircling a starving black hole that mimics the much larger discs found in extremely active galaxies.galaxiesOf particular interest, this disc of material circling the black hole offers a unique opportunity to test Albert Einstein's theories of relativity. The disc is so deeply embedded in the black hole's intense gravitational field that the light from the gas disc is altered, according to these theories, giving astronomers a unique peek at the dynamic processes close to a black hole.light""We've never seen the effects of both general and special relativity in visible light with this much clarity,"" said team member Marco Chiaberge of AURA for ESA, STScI and Johns Hopkins Univeristy.visible lightThe disc's material was measured by Hubble to be whirling around the black hole at more than 10% of the speed of light. At such extreme velocities, the gas appears to brighten as it travels toward Earth on one side, and dims as it speeds away from our planet on the other. This effect is known as relativistic beaming. Hubble's observations also show that the gas is embedded so deep in a gravitational well that light is struggling to escape, and therefore appears stretched to redder wavelengths. The black hole's mass is around 250 million times that of the Sun.""This is an intriguing peek at a disc very close to a black hole, so close that the velocities and the intensity of the gravitational pull are affecting how we see the photons of light,"" explained the study's first author, Stefano Bianchi, of Università degli Studi Roma Tre in Italy.In order to study the matter swirling deep inside this disc, the researchers used the Hubble Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) instrument. This diagnostic tool divides the light from an object into its many individual wavelengths to determine the object's speed, temperature, and other characteristics at very high precision. STIS was integral to effectively observing the low-luminosity region around the black hole, blocking out the galaxy's brilliant light.STISdiagnostic toolThe astronomers initially selected this galaxy to validate accepted models about lower-luminosity active galaxies: those with malnourished black holes. These models predict that discs of material should form when ample amounts of gas are trapped by a black hole's strong gravitational pull, subsequently emitting lots of light and producing a brilliant beacon called a quasar.black holes""The type of disc we see is a scaled-down quasar that we did not expect to exist,"" Bianchi explained. ""It's the same type of disc we see in objects that are 1000 or even 100 000 times more luminous. The predictions of current models for very faint active galaxies clearly failed.""The team hopes to use Hubble to hunt for other very compact discs around low-luminosity black holes in similar active galaxies.The team's paper will appear in the journal the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

The AI, called Pluribus, defeated poker professional Darren Elias, who holds the record for most World Poker Tour titles, and Chris ""Jesus"" Ferguson, winner of six World Series of Poker events. Each pro separately played 5,000 hands of poker against five copies of Pluribus.pokerIn another experiment involving 13 pros, all of whom have won more than $1 million playing poker, Pluribus played five pros at a time for a total of 10,000 hands and again emerged victorious.""Pluribus achieved superhuman performance at multi-player poker, which is a recognized milestone in artificial intelligence and in game theory that has been open for decades,"" said Tuomas Sandholm, Angel Jordan Professor of Computer Science, who developed Pluribus with Noam Brown, who is finishing his Ph.D. in Carnegie Mellon's Computer Science Department as a research scientist at Facebook AI. ""Thus far, superhuman AI milestones in strategic reasoning have been limited to two-party competition. The ability to beat five other players in such a complicated game opens up new opportunities to use AI to solve a wide variety of real-world problems.""game theoryA research paper describing this achievement in AI will be published online by the journal Science on Thursday, July 11, 2019.Science""Playing a six-player game rather than head-to-head requires fundamental changes in how the AI develops its playing strategy,"" said Brown, who joined Facebook AI last year. ""We're elated with its performance and believe some of Pluribus' playing strategies might even change the way pros play the game.""Pluribus' algorithms created some surprising features into its strategy. For instance, most human players avoid ""donk betting""—that is, ending one round with a call but then starting the next round with a bet. It's seen as a weak move that usually doesn't make strategic sense. But Pluribus placed donk bets far more often than the professionals it defeated.""Its major strength is its ability to use mixed strategies,"" Elias said last week as he prepared for the 2019 World Series of Poker main event. ""That's the same thing that humans try to do. It's a matter of execution for humans—to do this in a perfectly random way and to do so consistently. Most people just can't.""Pluribus registered a solid win with statistical significance, which is particularly impressive given its opposition, Elias said. ""The bot wasn't just playing against some middle of the road pros. It was playing some of the best players in the world.""Michael ""Gags"" Gagliano, who has earned nearly $2 million in career earnings, also competed against Pluribus.""It was incredibly fascinating getting to play against the poker bot and seeing some of the strategies it chose"" said Gagliano. ""There were several plays that humans simply are not making at all, especially relating to its bet sizing. Bots/AI are an important part in the evolution of poker, and it was amazing to have first-hand experience in this large step toward the future.""Sandholm has led a research team studying computer poker for more than 16 years. He and Brown earlier developed Libratus, which two years ago decisively beat four poker pros playing a combined 120,000 hands of heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em, a two-player version of the game.LibratusGames such as chess and Go have long served as milestones for AI research. In those games, all of the players know the status of the playing board and all of the pieces. But poker is a bigger challenge because it is an incomplete information game; players can't be certain which cards are in play and opponents can and will bluff. That makes it both a tougher AI challenge and more relevant to many real-world problems involving multiple parties and missing information.All of the AIs that displayed superhuman skills at two-player games did so by approximating what's called a Nash equilibrium. Named for the late Carnegie Mellon alumnus and Nobel laureate John Forbes Nash Jr., a Nash equilibrium is a pair of strategies (one per player) where neither player can benefit from changing strategy as long as the other player's strategy remains the same. Although the AI's strategy guarantees only a result no worse than a tie, the AI emerges victorious if its opponent makes miscalculations and can't maintain the equilibrium.In a game with more than two players, playing a Nash equilibrium can be a losing strategy. So Pluribus dispenses with theoretical guarantees of success and develops strategies that nevertheless enable it to consistently outplay opponents.Pluribus first computes a ""blueprint"" strategy by playing six copies of itself, which is sufficient for the first round of betting. From that point on, Pluribus does a more detailed search of possible moves in a finer-grained abstraction of game. It looks ahead several moves as it does so, but not requiring looking ahead all the way to the end of the game, which would be computationally prohibitive. Limited-lookahead search is a standard approach in perfect-information games, but is extremely challenging in imperfect-information games. A new limited-lookahead search algorithm is the main breakthrough that enabled Pluribus to achieve superhuman multi-player poker.Specifically, the search is an imperfect-information-game solve of a limited-lookahead subgame. At the leaves of that subgame, the AI considers five possible continuation strategies each opponent and itself might adopt for the rest of the game. The number of possible continuation strategies is far larger, but the researchers found that their algorithm only needs to consider five continuation strategies per player at each leaf to compute a strong, balanced overall strategy.Pluribus also seeks to be unpredictable. For instance, betting would make sense if the AI held the best possible hand, but if the AI bets only when it has the best hand, opponents will quickly catch on. So Pluribus calculates how it would act with every possible hand it could hold and then computes a strategy that is balanced across all of those possibilities.Though poker is an incredibly complicated game, Pluribus made efficient use of computation. AIs that have achieved recent milestones in games have used large numbers of servers and/or farms of GPUs; Libratus used around 15 million core hours to develop its strategies and, during live game play, used 1,400 CPU cores. Pluribus computed its blueprint strategy in eight days using only 12,400 core hours and used just 28 cores during live play.                                                                                                                        gamestrategy"
Artificial 'muscles' achieve powerful pulling force,https://techxplore.com/news/2019-07-artificial-muscles-powerful.html,https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/csz/news/325u/2019/5d270a66ed357.jpg,Engineering,"July 11, 2019","As a cucumber plant grows, it sprouts tightly coiled tendrils that seek out supports in order to pull the plant upward. This ensures the plant receives as much sunlight exposure as possible. Now, researchers at MIT have found a way to imitate this coiling-and-pulling mechanism to produce contracting fibers that could be used as artificial muscles for robots, prosthetic limbs, or other mechanical and biomedical applications.                                              While many different approaches have been used for creating artificial muscles, including hydraulic systems, servo motors, shape-memory metals, and polymers that respond to stimuli, they all have limitations, including high weight or slow response times. The new fiber-based system, by contrast, is extremely lightweight and can respond very quickly, the researchers say. The findings are being reported today in the journal Science.different approachesartificial musclesScienceThe new fibers were developed by MIT postdoc Mehmet Kanik and MIT graduate student Sirma Örgüç, working with professors Polina Anikeeva, Yoel Fink, Anantha Chandrakasan, and C. Cem Tasan, and five others, using a fiber-drawing technique to combine two dissimilar polymers into a single strand of fiber.The key to the process is mating together two materials that have very different thermal expansion coefficients—meaning they have different rates of expansion when they are heated. This is the same principle used in many thermostats, for example, using a bimetallic strip as a way of measuring temperature. As the joined material heats up, the side that wants to expand faster is held back by the other material. As a result, the bonded material curls up, bending toward the side that is expanding more slowly.materialsUsing two different polymers bonded together, a very stretchable cyclic copolymer elastomer and a much stiffer thermoplastic polyethylene, Kanik, Örgüç and colleagues produced a fiber that, when stretched out to several times its original length, naturally forms itself into a tight coil, very similar to the tendrils that cucumbers produce. But what happened next actually came as a surprise when the researchers first experienced it. ""There was a lot of serendipity in this,"" Anikeeva recalls.As soon as Kanik picked up the coiled fiber for the first time, the warmth of his hand alone caused the fiber to curl up more tightly. Following up on that observation, he found that even a small increase in temperature could make the coil tighten up, producing a surprisingly strong pulling force. Then, as soon as the temperature went back down, the fiber returned to its original length. In later testing, the team showed that this process of contracting and expanding could be repeated 10,000 times ""and it was still going strong,"" Anikeeva says.One of the reasons for that longevity, she says, is that ""everything is operating under very moderate conditions,"" including low activation temperatures. Just a 1-degree Celsius increase can be enough to start the fiber contraction.The fibers can span a wide range of sizes, from a few micrometers (millionths of a meter) to a few millimeters (thousandths of a meter) in width, and can easily be manufactured in batches up to hundreds of meters long. Tests have shown that a single fiber is capable of lifting loads of up to 650 times its own weight. For these experiments on individual fibers, Örgüç and Kanik have developed dedicated, miniaturized testing setups.The degree of tightening that occurs when the fiber is heated can be ""programmed"" by determining how much of an initial stretch to give the fiber. This allows the material to be tuned to exactly the amount of force needed and the amount of temperature change needed to trigger that force.The fibers are made using a fiber-drawing system, which makes it possible to incorporate other components into the fiber itself. Fiber drawing is done by creating an oversized version of the material, called a preform, which is then heated to a specific temperature at which the material becomes viscous. It can then be pulled, much like pulling taffy, to create a fiber that retains its internal structure but is a small fraction of the width of the preform.For testing purposes, the researchers coated the fibers with meshes of conductive nanowires. These meshes can be used as sensors to reveal the exact tension experienced or exerted by the fiber. In the future, these fibers could also include heating elements such as optical fibers or electrodes, providing a way of heating it internally without having to rely on any outside heat source to activate the contraction of the ""muscle.""Such fibers could find uses as actuators in robotic arms, legs, or grippers, and in prosthetic limbs, where their slight weight and fast response times could provide a significant advantage.Some prosthetic limbs today can weigh as much as 30 pounds, with much of the weight coming from actuators, which are often pneumatic or hydraulic; lighter-weight actuators could thus make life much easier for those who use prosthetics. Such fibers might also find uses in tiny biomedical devices, such as a medical robot that works by going into an artery and then being activated,"" Anikeeva suggests. ""We have activation times on the order of tens of milliseconds to seconds,"" depending on the dimensions, she says.prosthetic limbsTo provide greater strength for lifting heavier loads, the fibers can be bundled together, much as muscle fibers are bundled in the body. The team successfully tested bundles of 100 fibers. Through the fiber drawing process, sensors could also be incorporated in the fibers to provide feedback on conditions they encounter, such as in a prosthetic limb. Örgüç says bundled muscle fibers with a closed-loop feedback mechanism could find applications in robotic systems where automated and precise control are required.fibersKanik says that the possibilities for materials of this type are virtually limitless, because almost any combination of two materials with different thermal expansion rates could work, leaving a vast realm of possible combinations to explore. He adds that this new finding was like opening a new window, only to see ""a bunch of other windows"" waiting to be opened.""The strength of this work is coming from its simplicity,"" he says.

"For malnourished children, new therapeutic food boosts gut microbes, healthy development",https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-07-malnourished-children-therapeutic-food-boosts.html,https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/csz/news/325u/2019/formalnouris.jpg,Pediatrics,"July 11, 2019","A new type of therapeutic food, specifically designed to repair the gut microbiomes of malnourished children, is superior to standard therapy in an initial clinical trial conducted in Bangladesh.                                                An interdisciplinary team of investigators from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research in Dhaka, Bangladesh, have undertaken a new approach for addressing the pressing global health problem of childhood malnutrition. Their approach focuses on selectively boosting key growth-promoting gut microbes using ingredients present in affordable, culturally acceptable foods.Their work supports the notion that healthy growth of infants and children is inexorably linked to healthy development of their gut communities following birth. The results of their research are described in two reports published July 12 in the journal Science.childrenScience""We found that children who are malnourished have incompletely formed gut microbial communities compared with their healthy counterparts"" said senior author Jeffrey I. Gordon, MD, the Dr. Robert J. Glaser Distinguished University Professor and director of the Edison Family Center for Genome Sciences & Systems Biology at the School of Medicine. ""Therefore, we set about to design therapeutic foods to repair this immaturity and to determine whether such repair would restore healthy growth.""The clinical trial, which was conducted by a team led by Tahmeed Ahmed, Ph.D., the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research's director of Nutrition and Clinical Services, included 63 Bangladeshi children, 12-18 months of age, diagnosed with moderate acute malnutrition, meaning the children were ill but not close to death. The children were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups. Children in three of the groups each received one of the three newly designed therapeutic foods, while those in the fourth group received a standard therapeutic food that was not designed based on a consideration of its effects on the gut microbiome.All foods for the trial were locally produced at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research. Children were brought twice daily to a nutritional rehabilitation center, where the therapeutic foods were administered by their mothers under the supervision of health-care workers. A set of measuring tools, developed through advances in genomic medicine, provided a new, much more comprehensive definition of molecular features associated with malnutrition, its underlying mechanisms, and the effectiveness of treatment.One of the therapeutic foods stood out from the rest, even in this relatively short one-month trial. Measuring 1,300 blood proteins, including those intimately involved in directing bone growth, development of the brain, immune function, and metabolism in various tissues, revealed that this food prototype had produced a pronounced shift toward a healthy state compared with what was observed in the other three groups of children.At the end of the study, the researchers also found that, unlike in the three other treatment groups, the gut microbial communities residing in the intestines of children receiving this lead therapeutic food had undergone a reconfiguration and more closely resembled microbial communities found in age-matched healthy children living in the same locale. This formulation contained, among other components, a mixture of nutrients from chickpea, soy, bananas and peanuts.Childhood malnutrition is a massive global health problem, affecting 150 million children under age 5 worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Many studies have shown that malnutrition is the result of many factors, with reliable access to adequate amounts of affordable, nutritious food being one but not the only factor.Existing therapeutic foods were developed to increase the amount of key nutrients children consume. Malnourished children who receive these foods are less likely to die, but other consequences of malnutrition have remained largely unresponsive to treatment, including stunted growth, impaired immunity and reduced cognitive function. Gordon noted that these foods were not designed based on a consideration of their effects on the development of the gut microbiome.gut microbiomeThe new microbiome-directed therapeutic foods developed by the Washington University and International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research team emanated from their earlier studies of gut microbial community development in healthy children living in Bangladesh. Several years ago, the team discovered that children with malnutrition had immature gut communities—ones that appeared younger than their age-matched healthy counterparts. Ahmed noted that several years ago they found that conventional therapeutic foods failed to repair this immaturity in the malnourished children they had treated.Gordon's group went on to transplant immature communities from malnourished children, and normally maturing communities from healthy children, into mice that had been raised under sterile conditions. The results revealed that immature communities were associated with reduced weight gain, defective bone development plus abnormal metabolic and immune functions in the recipient animals. These findings provided early evidence that failure to form a normal microbial community may be a cause rather than simply an effect of malnutrition.""There is uncertainty about what foods are best to administer during the period of complementary feeding—when children transition from exclusive milk feeding to solid foods,"" Gordon said. ""Our studies were inspired by the notion that these commonly used, affordable, culturally acceptable complementary foods could contain ingredients coveted by key microbes that are underrepresented and underperforming in the gut microbiomes of malnourished children. These microbes were our therapeutic targets.""This study provides the first evidence that a therapeutic food, developed specifically to support growth and expansion of gut microbes linked to healthy microbiome development, has beneficial effects outside the gut related to many aspects of healthy growth. These effects involve key mediators of metabolism, and of bone, brain and immune system development—organ systems that have been very difficult to repair in malnourished children by supplementing their diet with traditional therapeutic foods.gut microbesIn first of the two papers—co-first authors Jeanette L. Gehrig, Ph.D., Siddarth Venkatesh, Ph.D., and Hao-Wei Chang, all members of the Gordon lab—describe how they first used germ-free mice, and then germ-free piglets, colonized with gut microbial community members from Bangladeshi children to screen a series of diets comprised of complementary food ingredients used in Bangladesh. They formulated Microbiome-Directed Complementary Food prototypes that could repair immature microbial communities from malnourished Bangladeshi children in both these animal models and improve the health of the animals. These prototypes then were tested in the double-blind controlled feeding study described above.In the second paper, first author Arjun S. Raman, MD, Ph.D., from the Gordon lab, describes development of new computational methods, based on methods originally developed by the field of econophysics to analyze how fluctuations in the economy affect features of complex, dynamic financial markets. The approach provided new, generally applicable ways of characterizing the organization of human gut communities—their normal development, how they are perturbed in disease states such as malnutrition, and how they respond to therapeutic interventions designed to repair them.""The goal of human microbiome research is not simply to describe the component parts of a microbial community but rather to characterize how the components interact with one another to shape community functions,"" Gordon said. ""Complicating matters, the number of possible interactions between the components in a gut community is literally astronomical.""According to Raman, the researchers wanted to be able to focus their attention, finding ways to reduce the number of components or features of the microbiome to a minimum number that could portray in an informative way the organizational properties of healthy and diseased gut communities.Studying the microbiomes of healthy Bangladeshi children sampled monthly from birth through five years, and using the new computational method, they identified a network of 15 gut bacterial community members that consistently interacted with one another. They named this network an ecogroup. The components of the ecogroup provided an accurate way of describing normal gut development of infants and children living in Bangladesh as well as several other low-income countries. It further served as a sensitive and accurate way of determining how severely disrupted microbial communities are in children with moderate and severe malnutrition, and the degree to which they are repaired with various treatments.""A longer and larger clinical trial is currently underway at two sites in Bangladesh to see if the new Microbiome-Directed Complementary Food has sustained benefits,"" Ahmed said. ""This trial includes children with moderate malnutrition as well as children with severe malnutrition treated with conventional therapy but left with incompletely repaired microbiomes, stunting and various other growth impairments.""Added Michael J. Barratt, Ph.D., an assistant professor of pathology and immunology and executive director of the Center for Gut Microbiome and Nutrition Research at Washington University: ""It is possible that some children may have gut microbial communities so damaged that a food-based intervention alone won't be sufficient. So our Washington University and International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research team is interested in studying the possibility of giving the specific beneficial organisms—or even the beneficial products those microbes make, as we become more knowledgeable about what those are—in combination with a Microbiome-Directed Complementary Food. That could be a second line of defense. Our studies also present the possibility of monitoring development of gut microbial communities and catching deviations from normal development earlier in life, giving us opportunities for prevention.""foodGordon emphasized that their efforts designed to repair the perturbed microbial communities of malnourished children hold the promise of revealing more informed guidelines for feeding children in the first several years of life so that they can develop healthy microbiomes.microbial communities""We need to be effective stewards of the precious microbial resources of our children,"" he said. ""If we are, the effects may be long-lived and herald a new dimension to preventive medicine—one that starts with their developing microbiomes.""
