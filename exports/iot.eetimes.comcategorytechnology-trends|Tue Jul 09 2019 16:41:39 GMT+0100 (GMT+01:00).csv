IoT Times is a Global Media Partner of the show, and we will be there to cover it from start to finish.Roger Bou is the Director of the IoT Congress, and the Technology Business Director of Fira Barcelona, the city’s fairs organization. He holds an MBA from ESADE Business School.We talked to Bou about this year’s show, the impact of 5G and AI in industrial IoT, and why Barcelona is attracting talent and companies in the IT industry.You can watch our interview with Roger Bou below. A full transcript of the interview follows the clip.IoT Times:      We are here with Roger Bou, Director of the IoT Solutions World Congress in Barcelona, and we are going to talk about this year’s show. Good afternoon, Roger. How are you doing?IoT TimesRoger Bou:    Hi, Pablo. How are you?Roger BouIoT Times:      This year will mark the fifth edition of the show. What do you think has changed in the IoT market during the past five years?IoT TimesRoger Bou:    Well, many things have changed during the past five years. If you remember, five years ago, people used to talk about M2M, not even about IoT. And I can remember clearly the first edition of the IoT [World Congress], that companies came here, and they didn’t have real solutions for IoT. They just were expecting a big growth of the market, and they wanted to be part of it in the future, but they didn’t really know what kind of solutions would these connective things develop for each of the industries now. And if you look now, you can see a solution for each of the vertical industries. In fact, this year, in this edition, you will see solutions that will impact very deep in the energy industry, in the healthcare industry, in the manufacturing industry, and not only in predictive maintenance or increasing productivity but also in the way they relate with their customers, and getting customer satisfaction with their solutions. So things have changed deeply, from just an expectation, to thinking of this will change the world, and have a big opportunity to deliver real solutions implemented in the market.Roger BouIoT Times:      That’s great. Why do you think Barcelona as a city is so attractive for technology companies to come here and do all these conferences?IoT TimesRoger Bou:    Well, that’s a good question, because Barcelona, you know well, has a very nice weather, nice people, good food. But I think the clue is not only this. That also is important, of course, but because it has a lot of talented people, it’s a hub for talent. I think it’s the fifth city in the world where people want to work. So it’s easy to attract talent here to Barcelona, and there’s a hub for talent and for the companies right now. So I think that mobile helped, once the Mobile [World Congress came] here, and started doing their event here year after year, and also the public, private collaboration between the institutions here and the private industry has helped to that. And so now I think we have become a hub for tech companies and for talent, and talent is, I think, the most needed resource for tech companies to success. So if you have the talent, you have the companies here.Roger BouIoT Times:      You are now preparing for this year’s show. Can you mention any technology that will be special this year?IoT TimesRoger Bou:    We’ll have some new technologies. I would mention 5G. A lot of people [are] speaking about 5G nowadays. We have just reached an agreement with Mobile World Capital to deploy here in the show, 5G for solutions in vertical industries. So you will be able to see mobility solutions in the show, autonomous vehicles working with 5G, and also solutions for healthcare and manufacturing, also deployed here during the event. So this is one of the enabling technologies for IoT that will help to develop IoT easier and faster. And we’ll have that, but we also are working very hard on blockchain and decentralized internet, and we’ll have workshops for developers and programmers to get real knowledge here in the show, on how different platforms of blockchain work, and how decentralized internet work, and cybersecurity. So we’re working different technologies, all of them with the same goal that’s helping digitize industries.Roger BouIoT Times:      During the past two-three years, the buzzwords today are artificial intelligence, machine learning, neural networks. How do you see all these technologies working on IoT and the impact of the technology in this ecosystem?IoT TimesRoger Bou:    Well I think that nowadays, most of the IoT solutions, they have also artificial intelligence on them, and it’s applying artificial intelligence on the connectivity, it’s what will give big changes and solutions to the IoT market, because it’s not only about connecting things but giving intelligence to these connections, so it can have intelligent decisions on the input that connections gives to you. And this is what will change really the market now. So I think it’s critical, and that’s why a year ago we adopted this technology in the IoT Solutions World Congress, and we have also the Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Systems Congress inside the IoT. And it’s getting more and more attractive year after year.Roger BouIoT Times:      That’s great. What are your expectations for this year’s show, in terms of attendance and people, companies, etc.?IoT TimesRoger Bou:    Well, if you look at the history year after year, we have more or less doubled in size year after year. And this year, luckily, I would say we’ll be again doubling. Cause if you remember last edition, we were in pavilion number two [of Fira Gran Via], not in all of it, and this year, we have all pavilion number two sold out, ready, and we are working now in pavilion number one, so we’ll have two pavilions working. Probably only IoT will be in pavilion number two, and pavilion number one [will be] about blockchain, the blockchain workshops, the decentralized internet, and cybersecurity, and maybe artificial intelligence.  It depends on how sales of exhibition space goes. So, we have great expectations.Roger BouIoT Times:      Okay, great. Thank you very much. I wish you a very good show.IoT TimesRoger Bou:    Thank you very much. See you there.Roger Bou"

"How IoT, artificial intelligence and edge computing are re-shaping thermal design",https://iot.eetimes.com/how-iot-artificial-intelligence-and-edge-computing-are-re-shaping-thermal-design/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/thermal-management-iot-450x270.jpg,Technology Trends,"May 6, 2019","With the proliferation of connected technologies, design engineers are being pushed to deliver products that are safer, more powerful, and increasingly reliable. A recent concern to crop up has to do with thermal applications – specifically, how the application of thermal analysis is an increasingly important step in the process of designing electronics devices for the IT and data center sectors.Over the next year, new thermal design priorities will largely be driven by technologies related to the internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), edge computing and 5G solutions. In fact, recent research from Future Facilities, which makes thermal design software, reported the following:During a digital roundtable event, thermal designers, engineers, and experts from a variety of organizations — including Facebook, HP Enterprise, QuantaCool, Engineered Fluids, CommScope, Vertiv, 6SigmaET, and Binghamton University — gathered to compare notes. The group identified a handful of thermal design priorities, including:At present, design engineers currently understand the complexity of thermal issues relating to these new technologies. But to improve processes and performances, they need to better understand the nuances. Author Hailey McKeefrey cites the following as an example:To further embolden this point, Ernesto Ferrer, thermal engineer at HP Enterprise is quoted saying: “Both AI and the IoT will drive innovative cooling solutions in the future in order to meet changing thermal demands. Components and systems that were air-cooled will need to use evermore innovative cooling techniques — increasingly liquid cooling, hybrid cooling, and full immersion cooling.”What’s more, engineers are beginning to struggle with the potentially harsher environments that will be present in emerging edge data centers. “Edge computing will mean taking data centers in a telecom-centric direction; this will require a cross-over period between these two industries that tend to cool their systems in completely different ways,” said Tom Craft, director of engineering at CommScope.Read the rest of the story on our sister site EEWeb"
Battery-less IoT could soon be a reality with Bluetooth multi-sensor platform,https://iot.eetimes.com/battery-less-iot-could-soon-be-a-reality-with-bluetooth-multi-sensor-platform/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/on-semi-rs10-450x270.jpg,Technology Trends,"May 2, 2019","ON Semiconductor continues to make significant progress in the company’s development of battery-less and maintenance-free IoT solutions. This is best evidenced by the company’s most recent introduction of the RSL10 Multi-Sensor Platform, which is powered with just a solar cell.This new solution supports the development of IoT sensors using continuous solar energy harvesting to gather and communicate data via Bluetooth® Low Energy, without the need for batteries or other forms of non-renewable energy.From the company’s release:Taking a bit of a closer look, the platform combines the RSL10 SIP with a solar cell and a host of low power sensors from Bosch Sensortec, including the BME280 all-in-one environmental sensor (pressure, temperature, humidity) as well as the BMA400 ultra-low-power 3-axis accelerometer. When combined, developers and manufacturers are able to create complete IoT nodes entirely powered through renewable energy or energy harvested from the sensor’s surroundings.For those wondering where this need comes from, there are a growing number of IoT sensor applications where the duty cycle is low enough to support intermittent communications. This, in turn, allows the energy needed to support operation to be harvested using renewable sources. The energy efficiency of the RSL10, specifically, is augmented by the incredibly efficient power management system and ultra-low-power sensors implemented in the platform.As or applications, the RSL10 Solar Cell Multi-Sensor Platform is expected to be used for smart home and building automation needs like HVAC control, window/door sensors and air quality monitoring. Asset tracking including package open/close detection, shock monitoring, and temperature and humidity data logging are also possible applications.For the developer, it is worth noting that the platform is supplied with all design files (Gerber, schematic and BoM) and customizable source code as part of a CMSIS software package. The RSL10 Solar Cell Multi-Sensor Platform is available now from ON Semiconductor alongside a number of other energy-efficient rapid prototyping platforms for IoT, including the Energy Harvesting Bluetooth Low Energy Switch.Via our sister site IoT-Design-Zone"

While much of the first part of the interview focused on his company’s technical efforts in the space, the following focuses on his outlook for the industry at large.***Continuation of previous interview***IoT Times: Talking about the automotive industry, one of the biggest things is the supply chain. Their supply chain has been built over many years. This morning, you talked about the way that car and vehicle manufacturers are going top down, pushing their supply chains to embrace these new technologies. How is that going to affect in terms of, for example, jobs, and the way that people are working? Because in reality, the supply chains and the supply parks that are near the factories employ more people than the factories themselves.IoT Times:Ramón Pastor: The supply chain, what I was talking about this morning is that when there is a new technology coming, what the big manufacturers do is they qualify themselves the technology. They get comfortable with the technology. They manufacture with this technology to get the knowledge, and once they are convinced, they use their existing supply chain for mass production. It’s not that the big car companies are going to begin to get the business out of tier one or tier two. What they are doing now is getting comfortable, qualifying the technology, making sure that they establish all the processes, the quality control needed, and when they are ready, then they deploy to tier one and tier two suppliers. I don’t think there is going to be a significant change in the next few years in the automotive supply chain because of this. However, it’s true that in between, while they’re qualified, they [the car manufacturers] are producing their own parts themselves.Ramón Pastor:IoT Times: So, all these people in the supply chain, they really need to act quickly, and there will be some that they’re not going to survive?IoT Times:Ramón Pastor:   Absolutely, and that’s a great point. Every new technology opens the door to new players. So the tier one and tier two suppliers need to adapt because if they don’t, there will be other players that take their place for these type of components.Ramón Pastor:IoT Times: You talked about the circular economy, and this is one of the big themes today.  The materials that you’re using which are in general thermoplastics. First of all, they’re using fossil fuels, then to generate those materials, you need to use energy. Moreover, later, you need to recycle them. I’ve seen your machines and the way that they reuse the plastics that are not used at that moment and then go into the next load. But, what happens with the pieces after they’re being used for months, years, whatever? Is there any plan for that?IoT Times:Ramón Pastor:   Two things. First, we’re printing many types of thermoplastics. The other thing about thermoplastics, they’re 100 percent recyclable; that’s a great thing. Today, half of the materials that we offer come from a vegetable source, not fuel.  What we have is a take-back program for the powder that sometimes is not used; although you can recycle 100 percent of the product, sometimes people want to dispose of it. We provide a service to take it back and recondition that powder to be able to use it again. That’s one side. The second side of this is what happens with the part. It is the same for all technologies. So, if the part is in good condition, it will be used. If the part can’t be longer used, it is recycled.Ramón Pastor:IoT Times: Is there anything on working with metals, working with different types of materials that were not available three years ago?IoT Times:Ramón Pastor:  Today, the 3D printers that we offer work for plastic, using the Jet Fusion technology. We announced last year that we are going to the market with a new metal technology called Metal Jet, which is going to be widely available in a couple of years. However, meanwhile, this year, we are starting to offer parts service to customers that want to try our technology, and we’re working with two partners, GKN and Pharmatech, that have big factories, producing for the automotive market and for the healthcare market, and they have begun to produce [metal] parts . We start with stainless steel, but this is only the first of the metals that we will offer in the future.  It’s going to be a different machine, a different technology than Jet Fusion. It shares many technology assets, but are different.Ramón Pastor:GKN Powder Metallurgy and HP Metal Jet functional metal part – Courtesy of HPGKN Powder Metallurgy and HP Metal Jet functional metal part – Courtesy of HPIoT Times: Last year, you gave estimates about TCOs for the use of your machines, and this year, I missed that part. Have there been any changes in economics, any significant changes in the last year, in the performance and the possibilities to use this technology instead of the traditional injection molding?IoT Times:Ramón Pastor: In terms of economics, no. The production models that we showed this year in the show, the Fusion Jet 4200 and 4210, are the same. So in this case, no change. We have introduced a new line, the 500 series, more suitable for prototyping, offering full color, which is a new add-on. That doesn’t mean that we’re not working on continuously improving this year, and we will improve in two areas. One, new products that we’ll introduce in the future, with similar technologies. The second part, we have been working a lot with our customers to improve equipment performance, which at the end is what is the uptime that the machine has, what is the performance that the machine has? What is the part quality percentage? What is the process capability index [CPK]?  So you reduce scrap, and you can improve the economics out of the machine through process control.Ramón Pastor:Did you miss part 1 of our interview with Ramón Pastor?

IoT data monetization: Turn your IoT data into additional revenue,https://iot.eetimes.com/iot-data-monetization-turn-your-iot-data-into-additional-revenue/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/01/story23-450x270.jpg,Technology Trends,"April 25, 2019","When it comes to the internet of things (IoT), most designers tend to focus on the hardware aspect of IoT devices. What modules are featured on the device and how can it be integrated into an overall design to be more efficient? It’s common that IoT devices are used to gather information on the system into which it is being integrated and decide on a course of action based on that data; that’s where it ends in most cases.But what if the data collected can be used for a whole new additional revenue stream for yourself or your company?Monetizing IoT dataMonetizing IoT dataThe concept of turning IoT data into a product to sell to others is an upward trend that companies have been looking at to add an additional revenue stream. Of course, the concept of selling data is nothing new. The production and consumption of information (data) in order to sell it or the buying of information can be called “infonomics,” coined by the information technology research and advisory firm Gartner. The only difference now is that with thousands of smart devices connected and continuously gathering data, there is an untapped market opportunity that many have not taken advantage of with this IoT data.Information is highly valuable and even more so for companies that might want to venture toward a new industry or improve in their current area, but they do not want raw data only, that which was collected from IoT devices. Unorganized data doesn’t mean much by itself, but if the data can be refined and identify patterns, it can take on real value to a person or company.An example of how you can monetize IoT data is if your company (or you) sells a smart device for a specific application and has it monitor useful information, such as energy efficiency or causes of malfunction, it can then turn that IoT data that was gathered through multiple devices in multiple situations and package it into a valuable “product” to sell to supporting manufacturers and service firms to use that data and find ways to improve their product or services. This not only helps reduce the effect of hardware erosion by providing additional revenue but proves how effective your devices can be.Companies have already used the concept of using the data that they collect from their IoT devices to improve their own products and services, meaning that collecting additional data points that are relevant to potential partners is something that they might want to consider adding to their devices.Challenges of monetizing IoT dataChallenges of monetizing IoT dataIn an interview with Doug Laney, Gartner’s chief data officer, Gregory Piatetsky asks about some challenges for organizations in monetizing information. While this interview is a general overview of all types of information, it can easily be applied to IoT data.Data quality: The IoT data that is being collected needs to be high-quality data. It will need to show the accuracy, completeness, integrity, timeliness and more for customers to trust the information being provided.Data quality:Determining types of information: Many companies may want IoT data in different forms that might not have been considered to fit their model. They might want more information on data points that were originally unrecorded. This will require flexibility to deliver these types of requests.Determining types of information:Classic product management/marketing approach: Because IoT data isn’t necessarily a physical product, it can cause some organizations to ignore typical activities that go into selling a physical device. This includes researching, designing, developing, packaging, promoting and supporting physical products or services.Classic product management/marketing approach:Protecting against unintended/unlicensed uses: Data can easily be copied, which can be great for licensing over and over but challenging to ensure against the customer using it in unintended ways. This means that contracts will need to be considered, requiring a licensed user to be trained on “safe and appropriate handling” of information products, enabling usage auditing and more.Protecting against unintended/unlicensed usesThe future of selling IoT dataThe future of selling IoT dataThis practice will continue to grow as more companies can tap into the power that IoT data can provide to others and how much they are willing to obtain that information. The IoT industry is growing, and even Japanese companies are working together to try to launch an IoT data-exchange platform by 2020 to help inspire new products and services.You can find example of companies finding ways to monetize IoT data. Samsung launched a service two years ago that will enable IoT device manufacturers and service providers to monetize IoT data. This allows you to partner up with Samsung and their Artik Cloud and provide ways to monetize the IoT data that it collects and earn revenue shares with devices that get used by third-party apps and services. Of course, this is one “ready-to-go” platform that can be implemented, but the process can be all up to the person.Just remember: Companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft thrive on collecting data and learning new ways to provide solutions. In this day and age of trying to be as efficient as possible, data is as valuable as it has ever been. Maybe that smart water system of yours that keeps track of leaks can be worth much more than you think."
New sensor development kit specially built for BLE radio,https://iot.eetimes.com/new-sensor-development-kit-specially-built-for-ble-radio/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/03/rsl10-sip-450x270.jpg,Technology Trends,"March 11, 2019","Well, this certainly looks to be useful. ON Semiconductor has just announced the launch of its new RSL10 Sensor Development Kit, which was specially designed to provide engineering teams with an intuitive sensor design platform built around the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio.This kit features 9 degrees of freedom (DoF) detection and environmental monitoring devices, including ambient light, pressure, relative humidity, and temperature sensors. It also includes an ultra-low-noise digital microphone, user-programmable RGB LED, three programmable pushbutton switches, and 64 Kb of EEPROM.The design engineer will appreciate the fact that ON Semiconductor’s new kit combines motion and environmental sensing with the ultra-low-power capabilities of the RSL10 Bluetooth 5 system-on-chip (SoC) to facilitate consumer and industrial IoT designs.For those wondering why BLE, it is worth pointing out that by and large the BLE is seen as a standard radio for smart sensor designs built around wireless communications. The RSL10 Bluetooth chip, specifically, comes in a 5.5-mm2 WLCSP, a 6 × 6-mm QFN package, and a system-in-package (SiP) with an integrated antenna.Worth highlighting is the fact that the RSL10 SiP also integrates a range of low-power sensors from Bosch Sensortec.
