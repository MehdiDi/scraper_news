New cellular IoT module brought to market – designed for both LTE-M and NB-IoT,https://iot.eetimes.com/new-cellular-iot-module-brought-to-market-designed-for-both-lte-m-and-nb-iot/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/01/nrf9160-450x270.jpg,Technology Trends,"January 7, 2019","Nordic Semiconductor has announced the official roll-out of the first device in its new nRF91 series. Per the company, this new cellular IoT module offers more security features than similar modules in the market today. That’s because the nRF9160 features both Arm’s TrustZone as well as CryptoCell security.As if that’s not impressive enough, the nRF9160 System-in-Package (SiP) is drop-in–ready with GCF, FCC, and CE certifications, enabling deployment in cellular networks and cellular IoT products worldwide.Per author Heather Hamilton:In its announcement, Nordic explained that it partnered with Qorvo to achieve a SiP that looks closer to an integrated chip than a module, leveraging Qorvo’s RF front end, advanced packaging, and MicroShield technology. The module is designed to support global operation with a single SiP variant thanks to Nordic’s multimode LTE-M/NB-IoT modem, SAW-less transceiver, and Qorvo’s custom RF front-end solution.The nRF9160 is the first IoT module to use Arm’s Cortex M-33 CPU core and is supported by 1 MB of Flash and 256 kB of RAM on-board memory. Other features include a broad range peripheral set, analog and digital interfaces, 32 GPIOs, a standalone modem with full LTE capability, and a multi-band RF front end.Also worth pointing out: The nRF9160 SiP also has integrated GPS support, which allows both GPS and cellular data to be used for more accurate positioning, said the company.For those curious, the new IoT module is supported by a development kit, SiP module samples, LTE-M firmware, and an SDK with an application example for cloud connectivity. Its meant to help engineers get a jumpstart with sensor-to-cloud IoT applications. Its also meant to serve as a quick, go-to resource for accessing Nordic’s cloud-based nRF Connect for Cloud management tool, PC-based nRF Connect for Desktop tool, and Segger Embedded Studio.At the moment, NB-IoT and GPS functionality is in limited sampling and will be available for evaluation through firmware updates in the first quarter of 2019.Via our sister site Electronic Products"
"In the age of IoT, how do we dispose of e-waste?",https://iot.eetimes.com/in-the-age-of-iot-how-do-we-dispose-of-e-waste/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/ewaste-450x270.png,Technology Trends,"December 24, 2018","With the proliferation of IoT devices, e-waste is fast becoming a bigger and bigger problem. Per the International Telecommunication Union, the world produces approximately 45 million tons of electronic waste (e-waste) each year. And that number is expected to continue rising.You see, when the useful life of an electronic device comes to an end, how to properly dispose of it is a challenge. Electronic devices contain toxic components, which can be harmful to the environment. What’s more, because these devices often contain personal and proprietary data, improperly disposing of them also leaves sensitive data open to exploitation. As the average cost of a data breach continues to rise (according to IBM it is nearing $4 million), this is a growing problem as well.To address this issue head-on, the StEP Initiative was launched by the United Nations; however, more needs to be done to ensure the safety and well-begin of today’s global population as well as future generations to come.Right now, there are four worthwhile solutions to this issue:When an electronic device can’t be reused as a whole entity, it’s possible that some of its components might be safely recovered. Otherwise, the device can be recycled according to best-practice industry standards.But before we get to any of these steps, identifying and properly disposing of IoT devices requires a transparent, robust ITAD process. Thorough, certified data sanitization that is performed to accepted industry standards is the first step in sustainable technology management. And there are a few companies out there that can capably perform this service.Read the full story on our sister site EETimes"

Gartner: Top 10 strategic IoT technology trends expected over next 5 years,https://iot.eetimes.com/gartner-top-10-strategic-iot-technology-trends-expected-over-next-5-years/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/01/story23-450x270.jpg,Technology Trends,"November 14, 2018","At its symposium in Barcelona last week, Gartner presented its top 10 strategic IoT technology trends for 2018 to 2023. Among the notable technologies: New, special purpose chips, increasingly sophisticated and low-cost sensors, combined hardware and software for trust platforms plus deployment of new wireless technologies, all of which are expected to emerge as some of the top strategic Internet of Things (IoT) technologies.The following is the full list for review:1: Artificial Intelligence (AI)1: Artificial Intelligence (AI)According to Gartner, 14.2 billion connected things are forecasted to be in use in 2019, and that this total will reach 25 billion by 2021, producing an immense volume of data which, in turn, will help make IoT meaningful as AI is applied to a wide range of IoT information.2: Infonomics and Data Broking2: Infonomics and Data BrokingOver the next half-decade, the buying and selling of IoT data will become a major part of many IoT systems. As such, organizations will need to understand the risks and opportunities related to data broking and set appropriate IT policies in place.3: IoT Governance3: IoT GovernanceAs the IoT grows, the need for a governance framework that ensures appropriate behavior in the creation, storage, use and deletion of information related to IoT technologies will become increasingly important. This ranges from simple technical tasks to more complex issues—and everything in between.4: New Wireless Networking Technologies for IoT4: New Wireless Networking Technologies for IoTIoT networking involves balancing a set of competing requirements like endpoint cost, power consumption, bandwidth and more. While no single networking technology optimizes all of these yet, new IoT networking technologies will soon provide even more choice and flexibility. In particular network technologies like 5G, the forthcoming generation of low earth orbit satellites, and backscatter networks could be explored further.5: Novel IoT User Experiences5: Novel IoT User ExperiencesThe IoT user experience (UX) will be driven by four factors: New sensors, new algorithms, new experience architectures and context, and socially aware experiences. With an increasing number of interactions occurring with things that don’t have screens and keyboards, organizations’ UX designers will be required to use new technologies and adopt new perspectives if they want to create a superior UX.6: Sensor Innovation6: Sensor InnovationThe sensor market will continue to mature through 2023: New sensors will enable a wider range of events to be detected, current sensors will reduce in price or be packaged in new ways to support new applications and new algorithms will emerge to gather even more information.7: Shift from Intelligent Edge to Intelligent Mesh7: Shift from Intelligent Edge to Intelligent MeshThe move from centralized and cloud to edge architectures is already under way in the IoT space; however, this is not the end point. That’s because the set of layers associated with edge architecture will evolve to a more unstructured architecture comprising of a wide range of “things” and services connected in a dynamic mesh which, in turn, will enable more flexible, intelligent and responsive IoT systems.8: Silicon Chip Innovation8: Silicon Chip InnovationGartner states that while the majority of current IoT endpoint devices use conventional processor chips, traditional instruction sets and memory architectures aren’t well-suited to all the tasks that endpoints need to perform. As such, the research firm expects that by 2023, new special-purpose chips will reduce the power consumption required to run a DNN, enabling new edge architectures and embedded DNN functions in low-power IoT endpoints to support new capabilities such as data analytics integrated with sensors, and speech recognition included in low cost battery-powered devices.9: Social, Legal and Ethical IoT9: Social, Legal and Ethical IoTAs the IoT becomes more widely deployed, a range of social, legal and ethical issues will grow in importance, including ownership of data and the deductions made from it; algorithmic bias; privacy; and compliance with regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation.10: Trusted Hardware and Operating System10: Trusted Hardware and Operating SystemBy 2023, Gartner expects to see the deployment of hardware and software combinations that together create more trustworthy and secure IoT systems. This will come about as the result of organizations currently not having control over the source and nature of the software and hardware being utilized in IoT initiatives.Read the full story on our sister site EETimes"
"To comply with GDPR, most data should remain at the edge",https://iot.eetimes.com/to-comply-with-gdpr-most-data-should-remain-at-the-edge/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/10/gdpr-3518254_1920-450x270.jpg,Technology Trends,"October 31, 2018","Barcelona–If there has been a theme capturing the attention of technology conferences’ attendees over the past two years, it would be GDPR.Barcelona–It doesn’t matter if the conversation is about wearables, 5G networks, Edge computing, payment systems, CCTV, or transit cards, at some point in the discussion the renowned four-letter acronym pops up. The recent IoT Solutions World Congress was no exception. During the session IoT, data and AI  as key levers of digital transformation,  Patrice Slupowski. Senior Vice-President Digital Innovation at Orange, argued that GDPR compliance is one the most challenging issues companies are facing when implementing IoT technologies.Slupowski praised the new regulation as the building stone to protect citizens from the dangers of data profiling and discrimination by algorithms.During his recent speech at the European Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners, Apple’s CEO Tim Cook praised the GDPR as an example that other governments should follow.“This year, you’ve shown the world that good policy and political will can come together to protect the rights of everyone. We should celebrate the transformative work of the European institutions tasked with the successful implementation of the GDPR…. It is time for the rest of the world, including my home country, to follow your lead.” Cook said.Worldwide, close to 8,000 new devices connect to the Internet every minute, 345 million per month, which will grow to an expected 50 billion by 2020. All these devices are designed to collect and transmit data.For example, most households in Europe and the US already have one connected device (wanted or not): the smart meter. Whether for electricity, gas, or water, smart meters collect thousands of data points per month, and sometimes every day.  smart meterThat data, attached to the resident’s account number, can be used to help the user choose a better service plan, adjust consumption, and improve the utility company’s forecast of the area demands. The same data, however, can also be used to determine the resident’s behavior, when the house or apartment is empty, what appliances are in use and, in some cases, how many people are on the premises. All of that without WiFi or any other internet connection service present in the house. Other examples include the increasing number of appliances on the market that are equipped with “smart features.” Smart TVs, refrigerators, washing machines, thermostats, etc. all these appliances, connected to the cloud via our WiFi and mobile apps, continuously send information about our habits, including what TV programs we watch, the food we buy, the clothes we wash and, obviously, the time we spend at home.Tim Cook was adamant about the dangers of over-collecting data: “These scraps of data, each one harmless enough on its own, are carefully assembled, synthesized, traded, and sold. Taken to its extreme, this process creates an enduring digital profile, and lets companies know you better than you may know yourself…. We shouldn’t sugarcoat the consequences: This is surveillance, and these stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich the companies that collect them.” This is surveillanceThe GDPR is explicit: Data collected should be used only to provide the service or services that users signed up for. The only exception that doesn’t require explicit user consent is data needed to comply with government regulations.Otherwise, any company collecting data requires opt-in consent from the user or customer. And a customer’s refusal to opt-in cannot be used to deny access to the product or service.That’s why it is essential to implement privacy-by-design and keep raw collected data at the edge.Going back to the smart meter example: It is legal for a utility company to aggregate the data collected by hundreds of smart meters in one area (i.e., a city block) using a local gateway, and continuously send that aggregated data to their data centers, as long as it doesn’t include any individual metering. That helps the company manage the grid, forecast electricity use, and detect any problems or fraud in the area without invading individual privacy.Obviously, at the end of every billing cycle, the utility company needs to collect the total consumption of each home, but it will not have insight into the habits of individual customers.The GDPR and similar regulations appearing in countries such as Brazil and Singapore, are here to stay. Some companies are being investigated, and there are countries already filing cases against large corporations.We need corporations to take the letter and spirit of privacy regulations such as GDPR seriously, ensuring that privacy is respected and also helping people to trust adopting new technologies.

Good afternoon, Roger. How are you doing?IoT TimesRoger Bou:    Hi, Pablo. How are you?Roger BouIoT Times:      This year will mark the fifth edition of the show. What do you think has changed in the IoT market during the past five years?IoT TimesRoger Bou:    Well, many things have changed during the past five years. If you remember, five years ago, people used to talk about M2M, not even about IoT. And I can remember clearly the first edition of the IoT [World Congress], that companies came here, and they didn’t have real solutions for IoT. They just were expecting a big growth of the market, and they wanted to be part of it in the future, but they didn’t really know what kind of solutions would these connective things develop for each of the industries now. And if you look now, you can see a solution for each of the vertical industries. In fact, this year, in this edition, you will see solutions that will impact very deep in the energy industry, in the healthcare industry, in the manufacturing industry, and not only in predictive maintenance or increasing productivity but also in the way they relate with their customers, and getting customer satisfaction with their solutions. So things have changed deeply, from just an expectation, to thinking of this will change the world, and have a big opportunity to deliver real solutions implemented in the market.Roger BouIoT Times:      That’s great. Why do you think Barcelona as a city is so attractive for technology companies to come here and do all these conferences?IoT TimesRoger Bou:    Well, that’s a good question, because Barcelona, you know well, has a very nice weather, nice people, good food. But I think the clue is not only this. That also is important, of course, but because it has a lot of talented people, it’s a hub for talent. I think it’s the fifth city in the world where people want to work. So it’s easy to attract talent here to Barcelona, and there’s a hub for talent and for the companies right now. So I think that mobile helped, once the Mobile [World Congress came] here, and started doing their event here year after year, and also the public, private collaboration between the institutions here and the private industry has helped to that. And so now I think we have become a hub for tech companies and for talent, and talent is, I think, the most needed resource for tech companies to success. So if you have the talent, you have the companies here.Roger BouIoT Times:      You are now preparing for this year’s show. Can you mention any technology that will be special this year?IoT TimesRoger Bou:    We’ll have some new technologies. I would mention 5G. A lot of people [are] speaking about 5G nowadays. We have just reached an agreement with Mobile World Capital to deploy here in the show, 5G for solutions in vertical industries. So you will be able to see mobility solutions in the show, autonomous vehicles working with 5G, and also solutions for healthcare and manufacturing, also deployed here during the event. So this is one of the enabling technologies for IoT that will help to develop IoT easier and faster. And we’ll have that, but we also are working very hard on blockchain and decentralized internet, and we’ll have workshops for developers and programmers to get real knowledge here in the show, on how different platforms of blockchain work, and how decentralized internet work, and cybersecurity. So we’re working different technologies, all of them with the same goal that’s helping digitize industries.Roger BouIoT Times:      During the past two-three years, the buzzwords today are artificial intelligence, machine learning, neural networks. How do you see all these technologies working on IoT and the impact of the technology in this ecosystem?IoT TimesRoger Bou:    Well I think that nowadays, most of the IoT solutions, they have also artificial intelligence on them, and it’s applying artificial intelligence on the connectivity, it’s what will give big changes and solutions to the IoT market, because it’s not only about connecting things but giving intelligence to these connections, so it can have intelligent decisions on the input that connections gives to you. And this is what will change really the market now. So I think it’s critical, and that’s why a year ago we adopted this technology in the IoT Solutions World Congress, and we have also the Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Systems Congress inside the IoT. And it’s getting more and more attractive year after year.Roger BouIoT Times:      That’s great. What are your expectations for this year’s show, in terms of attendance and people, companies, etc.?IoT TimesRoger Bou:    Well, if you look at the history year after year, we have more or less doubled in size year after year. And this year, luckily, I would say we’ll be again doubling. Cause if you remember last edition, we were in pavilion number two [of Fira Gran Via], not in all of it, and this year, we have all pavilion number two sold out, ready, and we are working now in pavilion number one, so we’ll have two pavilions working. Probably only IoT will be in pavilion number two, and pavilion number one [will be] about blockchain, the blockchain workshops, the decentralized internet, and cybersecurity, and maybe artificial intelligence.  It depends on how sales of exhibition space goes. So, we have great expectations.Roger BouIoT Times:      Okay, great. Thank you very much. I wish you a very good show.IoT TimesRoger Bou:    Thank you very much. See you there.Roger Bou"

"How IoT, artificial intelligence and edge computing are re-shaping thermal design",https://iot.eetimes.com/how-iot-artificial-intelligence-and-edge-computing-are-re-shaping-thermal-design/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/thermal-management-iot-450x270.jpg,Technology Trends,"May 6, 2019","With the proliferation of connected technologies, design engineers are being pushed to deliver products that are safer, more powerful, and increasingly reliable. A recent concern to crop up has to do with thermal applications – specifically, how the application of thermal analysis is an increasingly important step in the process of designing electronics devices for the IT and data center sectors.Over the next year, new thermal design priorities will largely be driven by technologies related to the internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), edge computing and 5G solutions. In fact, recent research from Future Facilities, which makes thermal design software, reported the following:During a digital roundtable event, thermal designers, engineers, and experts from a variety of organizations — including Facebook, HP Enterprise, QuantaCool, Engineered Fluids, CommScope, Vertiv, 6SigmaET, and Binghamton University — gathered to compare notes. The group identified a handful of thermal design priorities, including:At present, design engineers currently understand the complexity of thermal issues relating to these new technologies. But to improve processes and performances, they need to better understand the nuances. Author Hailey McKeefrey cites the following as an example:To further embolden this point, Ernesto Ferrer, thermal engineer at HP Enterprise is quoted saying: “Both AI and the IoT will drive innovative cooling solutions in the future in order to meet changing thermal demands. Components and systems that were air-cooled will need to use evermore innovative cooling techniques — increasingly liquid cooling, hybrid cooling, and full immersion cooling.”What’s more, engineers are beginning to struggle with the potentially harsher environments that will be present in emerging edge data centers. “Edge computing will mean taking data centers in a telecom-centric direction; this will require a cross-over period between these two industries that tend to cool their systems in completely different ways,” said Tom Craft, director of engineering at CommScope.Read the rest of the story on our sister site EEWeb"
Battery-less IoT could soon be a reality with Bluetooth multi-sensor platform,https://iot.eetimes.com/battery-less-iot-could-soon-be-a-reality-with-bluetooth-multi-sensor-platform/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/on-semi-rs10-450x270.jpg,Technology Trends,"May 2, 2019","ON Semiconductor continues to make significant progress in the company’s development of battery-less and maintenance-free IoT solutions. This is best evidenced by the company’s most recent introduction of the RSL10 Multi-Sensor Platform, which is powered with just a solar cell.This new solution supports the development of IoT sensors using continuous solar energy harvesting to gather and communicate data via Bluetooth® Low Energy, without the need for batteries or other forms of non-renewable energy.From the company’s release:Taking a bit of a closer look, the platform combines the RSL10 SIP with a solar cell and a host of low power sensors from Bosch Sensortec, including the BME280 all-in-one environmental sensor (pressure, temperature, humidity) as well as the BMA400 ultra-low-power 3-axis accelerometer. When combined, developers and manufacturers are able to create complete IoT nodes entirely powered through renewable energy or energy harvested from the sensor’s surroundings.For those wondering where this need comes from, there are a growing number of IoT sensor applications where the duty cycle is low enough to support intermittent communications. This, in turn, allows the energy needed to support operation to be harvested using renewable sources. The energy efficiency of the RSL10, specifically, is augmented by the incredibly efficient power management system and ultra-low-power sensors implemented in the platform.As or applications, the RSL10 Solar Cell Multi-Sensor Platform is expected to be used for smart home and building automation needs like HVAC control, window/door sensors and air quality monitoring. Asset tracking including package open/close detection, shock monitoring, and temperature and humidity data logging are also possible applications.For the developer, it is worth noting that the platform is supplied with all design files (Gerber, schematic and BoM) and customizable source code as part of a CMSIS software package. The RSL10 Solar Cell Multi-Sensor Platform is available now from ON Semiconductor alongside a number of other energy-efficient rapid prototyping platforms for IoT, including the Energy Harvesting Bluetooth Low Energy Switch.Via our sister site IoT-Design-Zone"

While much of the first part of the interview focused on his company’s technical efforts in the space, the following focuses on his outlook for the industry at large.***Continuation of previous interview***IoT Times: Talking about the automotive industry, one of the biggest things is the supply chain. Their supply chain has been built over many years. This morning, you talked about the way that car and vehicle manufacturers are going top down, pushing their supply chains to embrace these new technologies. How is that going to affect in terms of, for example, jobs, and the way that people are working? Because in reality, the supply chains and the supply parks that are near the factories employ more people than the factories themselves.IoT Times:Ramón Pastor: The supply chain, what I was talking about this morning is that when there is a new technology coming, what the big manufacturers do is they qualify themselves the technology. They get comfortable with the technology. They manufacture with this technology to get the knowledge, and once they are convinced, they use their existing supply chain for mass production. It’s not that the big car companies are going to begin to get the business out of tier one or tier two. What they are doing now is getting comfortable, qualifying the technology, making sure that they establish all the processes, the quality control needed, and when they are ready, then they deploy to tier one and tier two suppliers. I don’t think there is going to be a significant change in the next few years in the automotive supply chain because of this. However, it’s true that in between, while they’re qualified, they [the car manufacturers] are producing their own parts themselves.Ramón Pastor:IoT Times: So, all these people in the supply chain, they really need to act quickly, and there will be some that they’re not going to survive?IoT Times:Ramón Pastor:   Absolutely, and that’s a great point. Every new technology opens the door to new players. So the tier one and tier two suppliers need to adapt because if they don’t, there will be other players that take their place for these type of components.Ramón Pastor:IoT Times: You talked about the circular economy, and this is one of the big themes today.  The materials that you’re using which are in general thermoplastics. First of all, they’re using fossil fuels, then to generate those materials, you need to use energy. Moreover, later, you need to recycle them. I’ve seen your machines and the way that they reuse the plastics that are not used at that moment and then go into the next load. But, what happens with the pieces after they’re being used for months, years, whatever? Is there any plan for that?IoT Times:Ramón Pastor:   Two things. First, we’re printing many types of thermoplastics. The other thing about thermoplastics, they’re 100 percent recyclable; that’s a great thing. Today, half of the materials that we offer come from a vegetable source, not fuel.  What we have is a take-back program for the powder that sometimes is not used; although you can recycle 100 percent of the product, sometimes people want to dispose of it. We provide a service to take it back and recondition that powder to be able to use it again. That’s one side. The second side of this is what happens with the part. It is the same for all technologies. So, if the part is in good condition, it will be used. If the part can’t be longer used, it is recycled.Ramón Pastor:IoT Times: Is there anything on working with metals, working with different types of materials that were not available three years ago?IoT Times:Ramón Pastor:  Today, the 3D printers that we offer work for plastic, using the Jet Fusion technology. We announced last year that we are going to the market with a new metal technology called Metal Jet, which is going to be widely available in a couple of years. However, meanwhile, this year, we are starting to offer parts service to customers that want to try our technology, and we’re working with two partners, GKN and Pharmatech, that have big factories, producing for the automotive market and for the healthcare market, and they have begun to produce [metal] parts . We start with stainless steel, but this is only the first of the metals that we will offer in the future.  It’s going to be a different machine, a different technology than Jet Fusion. It shares many technology assets, but are different.Ramón Pastor:GKN Powder Metallurgy and HP Metal Jet functional metal part – Courtesy of HPGKN Powder Metallurgy and HP Metal Jet functional metal part – Courtesy of HPIoT Times: Last year, you gave estimates about TCOs for the use of your machines, and this year, I missed that part. Have there been any changes in economics, any significant changes in the last year, in the performance and the possibilities to use this technology instead of the traditional injection molding?IoT Times:Ramón Pastor: In terms of economics, no. The production models that we showed this year in the show, the Fusion Jet 4200 and 4210, are the same. So in this case, no change. We have introduced a new line, the 500 series, more suitable for prototyping, offering full color, which is a new add-on. That doesn’t mean that we’re not working on continuously improving this year, and we will improve in two areas. One, new products that we’ll introduce in the future, with similar technologies. The second part, we have been working a lot with our customers to improve equipment performance, which at the end is what is the uptime that the machine has, what is the performance that the machine has? What is the part quality percentage? What is the process capability index [CPK]?  So you reduce scrap, and you can improve the economics out of the machine through process control.Ramón Pastor:Did you miss part 1 of our interview with Ramón Pastor?

IoT data monetization: Turn your IoT data into additional revenue,https://iot.eetimes.com/iot-data-monetization-turn-your-iot-data-into-additional-revenue/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/01/story23-450x270.jpg,Technology Trends,"April 25, 2019","When it comes to the internet of things (IoT), most designers tend to focus on the hardware aspect of IoT devices. What modules are featured on the device and how can it be integrated into an overall design to be more efficient? It’s common that IoT devices are used to gather information on the system into which it is being integrated and decide on a course of action based on that data; that’s where it ends in most cases.But what if the data collected can be used for a whole new additional revenue stream for yourself or your company?Monetizing IoT dataMonetizing IoT dataThe concept of turning IoT data into a product to sell to others is an upward trend that companies have been looking at to add an additional revenue stream. Of course, the concept of selling data is nothing new. The production and consumption of information (data) in order to sell it or the buying of information can be called “infonomics,” coined by the information technology research and advisory firm Gartner. The only difference now is that with thousands of smart devices connected and continuously gathering data, there is an untapped market opportunity that many have not taken advantage of with this IoT data.Information is highly valuable and even more so for companies that might want to venture toward a new industry or improve in their current area, but they do not want raw data only, that which was collected from IoT devices. Unorganized data doesn’t mean much by itself, but if the data can be refined and identify patterns, it can take on real value to a person or company.An example of how you can monetize IoT data is if your company (or you) sells a smart device for a specific application and has it monitor useful information, such as energy efficiency or causes of malfunction, it can then turn that IoT data that was gathered through multiple devices in multiple situations and package it into a valuable “product” to sell to supporting manufacturers and service firms to use that data and find ways to improve their product or services. This not only helps reduce the effect of hardware erosion by providing additional revenue but proves how effective your devices can be.Companies have already used the concept of using the data that they collect from their IoT devices to improve their own products and services, meaning that collecting additional data points that are relevant to potential partners is something that they might want to consider adding to their devices.Challenges of monetizing IoT dataChallenges of monetizing IoT dataIn an interview with Doug Laney, Gartner’s chief data officer, Gregory Piatetsky asks about some challenges for organizations in monetizing information. While this interview is a general overview of all types of information, it can easily be applied to IoT data.Data quality: The IoT data that is being collected needs to be high-quality data. It will need to show the accuracy, completeness, integrity, timeliness and more for customers to trust the information being provided.Data quality:Determining types of information: Many companies may want IoT data in different forms that might not have been considered to fit their model. They might want more information on data points that were originally unrecorded. This will require flexibility to deliver these types of requests.Determining types of information:Classic product management/marketing approach: Because IoT data isn’t necessarily a physical product, it can cause some organizations to ignore typical activities that go into selling a physical device. This includes researching, designing, developing, packaging, promoting and supporting physical products or services.Classic product management/marketing approach:Protecting against unintended/unlicensed uses: Data can easily be copied, which can be great for licensing over and over but challenging to ensure against the customer using it in unintended ways. This means that contracts will need to be considered, requiring a licensed user to be trained on “safe and appropriate handling” of information products, enabling usage auditing and more.Protecting against unintended/unlicensed usesThe future of selling IoT dataThe future of selling IoT dataThis practice will continue to grow as more companies can tap into the power that IoT data can provide to others and how much they are willing to obtain that information. The IoT industry is growing, and even Japanese companies are working together to try to launch an IoT data-exchange platform by 2020 to help inspire new products and services.You can find example of companies finding ways to monetize IoT data. Samsung launched a service two years ago that will enable IoT device manufacturers and service providers to monetize IoT data. This allows you to partner up with Samsung and their Artik Cloud and provide ways to monetize the IoT data that it collects and earn revenue shares with devices that get used by third-party apps and services. Of course, this is one “ready-to-go” platform that can be implemented, but the process can be all up to the person.Just remember: Companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft thrive on collecting data and learning new ways to provide solutions. In this day and age of trying to be as efficient as possible, data is as valuable as it has ever been. Maybe that smart water system of yours that keeps track of leaks can be worth much more than you think."
New sensor development kit specially built for BLE radio,https://iot.eetimes.com/new-sensor-development-kit-specially-built-for-ble-radio/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/03/rsl10-sip-450x270.jpg,Technology Trends,"March 11, 2019","Well, this certainly looks to be useful. ON Semiconductor has just announced the launch of its new RSL10 Sensor Development Kit, which was specially designed to provide engineering teams with an intuitive sensor design platform built around the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio.This kit features 9 degrees of freedom (DoF) detection and environmental monitoring devices, including ambient light, pressure, relative humidity, and temperature sensors. It also includes an ultra-low-noise digital microphone, user-programmable RGB LED, three programmable pushbutton switches, and 64 Kb of EEPROM.The design engineer will appreciate the fact that ON Semiconductor’s new kit combines motion and environmental sensing with the ultra-low-power capabilities of the RSL10 Bluetooth 5 system-on-chip (SoC) to facilitate consumer and industrial IoT designs.For those wondering why BLE, it is worth pointing out that by and large the BLE is seen as a standard radio for smart sensor designs built around wireless communications. The RSL10 Bluetooth chip, specifically, comes in a 5.5-mm2 WLCSP, a 6 × 6-mm QFN package, and a system-in-package (SiP) with an integrated antenna.Worth highlighting is the fact that the RSL10 SiP also integrates a range of low-power sensors from Bosch Sensortec. For example, the highly integrated BME680 environmental sensor is used to detect a wide range of gases for air-quality measurements. It also includes the BMM150 geomagnetic sensor and the BHI160 smart sensor for high-accuracy motion sensing.Developers that use the kit will be able to connect to the sensor dev kit to monitor sensors and evaluate features through the RSL10 sense and control mobile application. Its app supports several cloud platforms for uploading the sensor data.Via our sister site Electronic Products"

According a recent study conducted by Newark element14, it is the environmental sensor that is most often used in IoT applications.This begs the obvious question: what is an environmental sensor? To put it succinctly, these components measure things like humidity, temperature and pressure. According to 38% of respondents, they are most often used in IoT designs. Next are motion sensors with 25% of respondents saying they rely on this component to gather data, then opto/image sensors with 19%, followed by health monitoring sensors with 8% and audio sensors at 4%.The survey also asked about the increased role of hardware in IoT design: according to the results, 50% of developers use single board computers like the Raspberry Pi because they’re ready-to-use embedded development platforms. 27% of the group said they prefer to use personal designs and 19% said they use development platforms provided by silicon vendors.Furthermore, 58% of developers prefer to design a complete solution for edge-to-cloud security themselves; this, as opposed to relying on third-party solution providers (which could add some additional costs). While this is certainly a sizeable majority,, some survey respondents said they use third-party providers for edge-to-cloud communications (21%), designing edge devices (18%) and for data center/analytics (18%).Finally, it’s worth pointing out that the most preferred connectivity protocol between edge devices and the cloud is Wi-Fi (66%), according to survey respondents. The surveyors state that this is likely due to Wi-Fi’s long-range connectivity, higher throughput and the latest low-power microprocessors with integrated Wi-Fi on the chip.The second most popular communications protocol is cellular – 4G/LTE (31%), followed by Bluetooth Low Energy (27%), LoRa (11%) and 1 sub-GHz (7%).To learn more, check out the full survey. "

To give you a sample of what was discussed, Dave pointed out to Matt how the IOT industry is now addressing big things like interoperability, security and then posed the question: What does that mean in the context of wireless connectivity and those devices?Matt Johnson’s response:For interoperability and security, specifically, the easy way, at least that I would think about it is, it’s not going to happen unless those things happen. The interoperability is kind of foundational or elemental to having that experience when people purchase something or put something together, it needs to work. And that’s actually still a major challenge and opportunity that’s out there in the industry. It’s one of the things we really loved about Z-Wave and our acquisition there, because Z-Wave’s really focused on, first and foremost, interoperability. And they already have two or three thousand products that are certified and guaranteed to work together, which is huge. On the security side, I don’t think you have to debate or convince anyone how important that is. But one thing that’s really exciting to us, in the first half of this year, Silicon Labs is going to be announcing what we call our Series Two or next generation of IOT products. So we have a platform that we do every generation, and in this new generation, we’ve really pushed the bar… raised the bar or pushed the envelope on security. So hardware-level, chip-level. And it’s going to allow user authentication, it’s going to allow IP protection, consumer data protection. Because one of the things that could really derail this is if the security isn’t what it needs to be. You can imagine all the scenarios, and some we can’t even imagine, about how this could go wrong. So I’m proud that we’ve been pretty proactive in investing in security before it was even a big deal.For interoperability and security, specifically, the easy way, at least that I would think about it is, it’s not going to happen unless those things happen.

New cellular IoT module brought to market – designed for both LTE-M and NB-IoT,https://iot.eetimes.com/new-cellular-iot-module-brought-to-market-designed-for-both-lte-m-and-nb-iot/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/01/nrf9160-450x270.jpg,Technology Trends,"January 7, 2019","Nordic Semiconductor has announced the official roll-out of the first device in its new nRF91 series. Per the company, this new cellular IoT module offers more security features than similar modules in the market today. That’s because the nRF9160 features both Arm’s TrustZone as well as CryptoCell security.As if that’s not impressive enough, the nRF9160 System-in-Package (SiP) is drop-in–ready with GCF, FCC, and CE certifications, enabling deployment in cellular networks and cellular IoT products worldwide.Per author Heather Hamilton:In its announcement, Nordic explained that it partnered with Qorvo to achieve a SiP that looks closer to an integrated chip than a module, leveraging Qorvo’s RF front end, advanced packaging, and MicroShield technology. The module is designed to support global operation with a single SiP variant thanks to Nordic’s multimode LTE-M/NB-IoT modem, SAW-less transceiver, and Qorvo’s custom RF front-end solution.The nRF9160 is the first IoT module to use Arm’s Cortex M-33 CPU core and is supported by 1 MB of Flash and 256 kB of RAM on-board memory. Other features include a broad range peripheral set, analog and digital interfaces, 32 GPIOs, a standalone modem with full LTE capability, and a multi-band RF front end.Also worth pointing out: The nRF9160 SiP also has integrated GPS support, which allows both GPS and cellular data to be used for more accurate positioning, said the company.For those curious, the new IoT module is supported by a development kit, SiP module samples, LTE-M firmware, and an SDK with an application example for cloud connectivity. Its meant to help engineers get a jumpstart with sensor-to-cloud IoT applications. Its also meant to serve as a quick, go-to resource for accessing Nordic’s cloud-based nRF Connect for Cloud management tool, PC-based nRF Connect for Desktop tool, and Segger Embedded Studio.At the moment, NB-IoT and GPS functionality is in limited sampling and will be available for evaluation through firmware updates in the first quarter of 2019.Via our sister site Electronic Products"
"In the age of IoT, how do we dispose of e-waste?",https://iot.eetimes.com/in-the-age-of-iot-how-do-we-dispose-of-e-waste/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/ewaste-450x270.png,Technology Trends,"December 24, 2018","With the proliferation of IoT devices, e-waste is fast becoming a bigger and bigger problem. Per the International Telecommunication Union, the world produces approximately 45 million tons of electronic waste (e-waste) each year. And that number is expected to continue rising.You see, when the useful life of an electronic device comes to an end, how to properly dispose of it is a challenge. Electronic devices contain toxic components, which can be harmful to the environment. What’s more, because these devices often contain personal and proprietary data, improperly disposing of them also leaves sensitive data open to exploitation. As the average cost of a data breach continues to rise (according to IBM it is nearing $4 million), this is a growing problem as well.To address this issue head-on, the StEP Initiative was launched by the United Nations; however, more needs to be done to ensure the safety and well-begin of today’s global population as well as future generations to come.Right now, there are four worthwhile solutions to this issue:When an electronic device can’t be reused as a whole entity, it’s possible that some of its components might be safely recovered. Otherwise, the device can be recycled according to best-practice industry standards.But before we get to any of these steps, identifying and properly disposing of IoT devices requires a transparent, robust ITAD process. Thorough, certified data sanitization that is performed to accepted industry standards is the first step in sustainable technology management. And there are a few companies out there that can capably perform this service.Read the full story on our sister site EETimes"

Gartner: Top 10 strategic IoT technology trends expected over next 5 years,https://iot.eetimes.com/gartner-top-10-strategic-iot-technology-trends-expected-over-next-5-years/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/01/story23-450x270.jpg,Technology Trends,"November 14, 2018","At its symposium in Barcelona last week, Gartner presented its top 10 strategic IoT technology trends for 2018 to 2023. Among the notable technologies: New, special purpose chips, increasingly sophisticated and low-cost sensors, combined hardware and software for trust platforms plus deployment of new wireless technologies, all of which are expected to emerge as some of the top strategic Internet of Things (IoT) technologies.The following is the full list for review:1: Artificial Intelligence (AI)1: Artificial Intelligence (AI)According to Gartner, 14.2 billion connected things are forecasted to be in use in 2019, and that this total will reach 25 billion by 2021, producing an immense volume of data which, in turn, will help make IoT meaningful as AI is applied to a wide range of IoT information.2: Infonomics and Data Broking2: Infonomics and Data BrokingOver the next half-decade, the buying and selling of IoT data will become a major part of many IoT systems. As such, organizations will need to understand the risks and opportunities related to data broking and set appropriate IT policies in place.3: IoT Governance3: IoT GovernanceAs the IoT grows, the need for a governance framework that ensures appropriate behavior in the creation, storage, use and deletion of information related to IoT technologies will become increasingly important. This ranges from simple technical tasks to more complex issues—and everything in between.4: New Wireless Networking Technologies for IoT4: New Wireless Networking Technologies for IoTIoT networking involves balancing a set of competing requirements like endpoint cost, power consumption, bandwidth and more. While no single networking technology optimizes all of these yet, new IoT networking technologies will soon provide even more choice and flexibility. In particular network technologies like 5G, the forthcoming generation of low earth orbit satellites, and backscatter networks could be explored further.5: Novel IoT User Experiences5: Novel IoT User ExperiencesThe IoT user experience (UX) will be driven by four factors: New sensors, new algorithms, new experience architectures and context, and socially aware experiences. With an increasing number of interactions occurring with things that don’t have screens and keyboards, organizations’ UX designers will be required to use new technologies and adopt new perspectives if they want to create a superior UX.6: Sensor Innovation6: Sensor InnovationThe sensor market will continue to mature through 2023: New sensors will enable a wider range of events to be detected, current sensors will reduce in price or be packaged in new ways to support new applications and new algorithms will emerge to gather even more information.7: Shift from Intelligent Edge to Intelligent Mesh7: Shift from Intelligent Edge to Intelligent MeshThe move from centralized and cloud to edge architectures is already under way in the IoT space; however, this is not the end point. That’s because the set of layers associated with edge architecture will evolve to a more unstructured architecture comprising of a wide range of “things” and services connected in a dynamic mesh which, in turn, will enable more flexible, intelligent and responsive IoT systems.8: Silicon Chip Innovation8: Silicon Chip InnovationGartner states that while the majority of current IoT endpoint devices use conventional processor chips, traditional instruction sets and memory architectures aren’t well-suited to all the tasks that endpoints need to perform. As such, the research firm expects that by 2023, new special-purpose chips will reduce the power consumption required to run a DNN, enabling new edge architectures and embedded DNN functions in low-power IoT endpoints to support new capabilities such as data analytics integrated with sensors, and speech recognition included in low cost battery-powered devices.9: Social, Legal and Ethical IoT9: Social, Legal and Ethical IoTAs the IoT becomes more widely deployed, a range of social, legal and ethical issues will grow in importance, including ownership of data and the deductions made from it; algorithmic bias; privacy; and compliance with regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation.10: Trusted Hardware and Operating System10: Trusted Hardware and Operating SystemBy 2023, Gartner expects to see the deployment of hardware and software combinations that together create more trustworthy and secure IoT systems. This will come about as the result of organizations currently not having control over the source and nature of the software and hardware being utilized in IoT initiatives.Read the full story on our sister site EETimes"
"To comply with GDPR, most data should remain at the edge",https://iot.eetimes.com/to-comply-with-gdpr-most-data-should-remain-at-the-edge/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/10/gdpr-3518254_1920-450x270.jpg,Technology Trends,"October 31, 2018","Barcelona–If there has been a theme capturing the attention of technology conferences’ attendees over the past two years, it would be GDPR.Barcelona–It doesn’t matter if the conversation is about wearables, 5G networks, Edge computing, payment systems, CCTV, or transit cards, at some point in the discussion the renowned four-letter acronym pops up. The recent IoT Solutions World Congress was no exception. During the session IoT, data and AI  as key levers of digital transformation,  Patrice Slupowski. Senior Vice-President Digital Innovation at Orange, argued that GDPR compliance is one the most challenging issues companies are facing when implementing IoT technologies.Slupowski praised the new regulation as the building stone to protect citizens from the dangers of data profiling and discrimination by algorithms.During his recent speech at the European Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners, Apple’s CEO Tim Cook praised the GDPR as an example that other governments should follow.“This year, you’ve shown the world that good policy and political will can come together to protect the rights of everyone. We should celebrate the transformative work of the European institutions tasked with the successful implementation of the GDPR…. It is time for the rest of the world, including my home country, to follow your lead.” Cook said.Worldwide, close to 8,000 new devices connect to the Internet every minute, 345 million per month, which will grow to an expected 50 billion by 2020. All these devices are designed to collect and transmit data.For example, most households in Europe and the US already have one connected device (wanted or not): the smart meter. Whether for electricity, gas, or water, smart meters collect thousands of data points per month, and sometimes every day.  smart meterThat data, attached to the resident’s account number, can be used to help the user choose a better service plan, adjust consumption, and improve the utility company’s forecast of the area demands. The same data, however, can also be used to determine the resident’s behavior, when the house or apartment is empty, what appliances are in use and, in some cases, how many people are on the premises. All of that without WiFi or any other internet connection service present in the house. Other examples include the increasing number of appliances on the market that are equipped with “smart features.” Smart TVs, refrigerators, washing machines, thermostats, etc. all these appliances, connected to the cloud via our WiFi and mobile apps, continuously send information about our habits, including what TV programs we watch, the food we buy, the clothes we wash and, obviously, the time we spend at home.Tim Cook was adamant about the dangers of over-collecting data: “These scraps of data, each one harmless enough on its own, are carefully assembled, synthesized, traded, and sold. Taken to its extreme, this process creates an enduring digital profile, and lets companies know you better than you may know yourself…. We shouldn’t sugarcoat the consequences: This is surveillance, and these stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich the companies that collect them.” This is surveillanceThe GDPR is explicit: Data collected should be used only to provide the service or services that users signed up for. The only exception that doesn’t require explicit user consent is data needed to comply with government regulations.Otherwise, any company collecting data requires opt-in consent from the user or customer. And a customer’s refusal to opt-in cannot be used to deny access to the product or service.That’s why it is essential to implement privacy-by-design and keep raw collected data at the edge.Going back to the smart meter example: It is legal for a utility company to aggregate the data collected by hundreds of smart meters in one area (i.e., a city block) using a local gateway, and continuously send that aggregated data to their data centers, as long as it doesn’t include any individual metering. That helps the company manage the grid, forecast electricity use, and detect any problems or fraud in the area without invading individual privacy.Obviously, at the end of every billing cycle, the utility company needs to collect the total consumption of each home, but it will not have insight into the habits of individual customers.The GDPR and similar regulations appearing in countries such as Brazil and Singapore, are here to stay.

We expect to be the biggest IoT event of the year with over 14,000 attendees.Additionally, on the exhibition floor, we have increased the number of exhibitors, and exhibition space, 30% over last year. Companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Huawei, are coming back with a more substantial presence, both at the exhibition and at the Congress.One fact that shows the importance of the IoTSWC is that many companies are planning to make several product announcements during the show.Blockchain is becoming one of the most critical technologies for digital transformation, and AI is adding the intelligence layer to IoT. Many industrial IoT offerings are starting to add such techniques in addition to edge and cloud computing, to leverage the full power of big data and the information collected by IoT devices. Blockchain enables services such as securing the supply chain and predictive maintenance.This year the testbed area will have a premium location in the exhibition area, right in front of the entrance, in the middle of the Pavillion. We are going to have new, exciting testbeds and case studies featured at the show.One example is Emergency One, the UK’s leading manufacturer of Fire, Rescue and Emergency Vehicles, which use Vodafone IoT to connect fire engines for improved safety and efficiency.Another compelling use case is coming from Alaska, where they are using IoT technology for the protection of Beluga whales. Aridea Solutions (West Virginia) was tasked to design a solution to monitor a natural gas leak that was detected approximately 6 kilometers offshore in the Cook Inlet, where only around 300 to 400 Beluga whales live.  Aridea designed a buoy equipped with a special wireless sensor platform to monitor air and water near the leak affecting the Beluga whales and other aquatic mammals. The sensors are providing crucial data for analyzing the environmental impacts of the leak until repairs are completed.There will be some special events organized by some of the exhibitors that will take place before and during the show. One example is Microsoft’s IoT in Action, a one day conference with the top executives of the firm on intelligent edge, cloud, and IoT security.The most important parallel conference for me, however, will be Women Leadership on IoT, taking place on Oct. 16th, where inspirational women leaders in Industrial IoT representing established corporations will offer their perspectives on integrating gender equality into the digital transformation movement.IoT Times is a Global Media Partner of the IoT Solutions World Congress and we will be covering the most important events and talks during the show.IoT Times is a Global Media Partner of the IoT Solutions World Congress and we will be covering the most important events and talks during the show."

The company is reportedly in the final stages of acquiring Mountain View, Calif.-based data analytics firm Treasure Data for $600 million. This comes on the heels of its acquisition in June of Stream Technologies, a unified connectivity management platform for IoT devices, and its investment in San Jose-based SWIM.ai.News of this latest acquisition comes from people close to the deal. It also comes prior to the company’s planned “major IoT announcement” on August 7.While nothing is official, author Nitin Dahad speculates on what this (supposed) acquisition means:When it comes to Arm, it seems like those in charge have recognized that the route to profitability has to be this bigger ecosystem sell, and hence, the acquisition strategy would make sense.For instance, the acquisition of Stream provides the physical connectivity platform for IoT networks covering several wireless protocols. At the time of acquisition, it is said to have been maintaining 770,000 managed subscribers and handling 2 TB of traffic per day. Stream provides companies with the ability to deploy an IoT device, find a network, self-authenticate, automatically provision, and connect to the lowest-cost channel, removing the need to interface with multiple different network systems and develop several business contracts for the network connectivity.When the acquisition was announced, Arm said that, together with its Mbed IoT device management platform, the combination will provide organizations with a scalable end-to-end IoT platform for managing, connecting, provisioning and updating devices. In addition, Stream is also expected to work with mobile industry association GSMA to create compliant embedded subscriber identity module (eSIM) solutions to ensure secure identity and optimal connectivity for IoT devices from the chip to the cloud.As for Treasure Data — whose customers include SoftBank, the owner of Arm — the company already provides data analytics solutions for automotive and IoT for firms like Pioneer, Mitsubishi, and Subaru. One of the company’s biggest selling points is its ability to ingest data from any connected device or machine, correlate data from multiple sources, and leverage machine learning to enable customers to act on the insights provided. It was founded by three Japanese entrepreneurs in California in 2011 and has received over $54 million in funding to date.Read the full story on our sister site EETimes"

IoT Times is a Global Media Partner of the show, and we will be there to cover it from start to finish.Roger Bou is the Director of the IoT Congress, and the Technology Business Director of Fira Barcelona, the city’s fairs organization. He holds an MBA from ESADE Business School.We talked to Bou about this year’s show, the impact of 5G and AI in industrial IoT, and why Barcelona is attracting talent and companies in the IT industry.You can watch our interview with Roger Bou below. A full transcript of the interview follows the clip.IoT Times:      We are here with Roger Bou, Director of the IoT Solutions World Congress in Barcelona, and we are going to talk about this year’s show. Good afternoon, Roger. How are you doing?IoT TimesRoger Bou:    Hi, Pablo. How are you?Roger BouIoT Times:      This year will mark the fifth edition of the show. What do you think has changed in the IoT market during the past five years?IoT TimesRoger Bou:    Well, many things have changed during the past five years. If you remember, five years ago, people used to talk about M2M, not even about IoT. And I can remember clearly the first edition of the IoT [World Congress], that companies came here, and they didn’t have real solutions for IoT. They just were expecting a big growth of the market, and they wanted to be part of it in the future, but they didn’t really know what kind of solutions would these connective things develop for each of the industries now. And if you look now, you can see a solution for each of the vertical industries. In fact, this year, in this edition, you will see solutions that will impact very deep in the energy industry, in the healthcare industry, in the manufacturing industry, and not only in predictive maintenance or increasing productivity but also in the way they relate with their customers, and getting customer satisfaction with their solutions. So things have changed deeply, from just an expectation, to thinking of this will change the world, and have a big opportunity to deliver real solutions implemented in the market.Roger BouIoT Times:      That’s great. Why do you think Barcelona as a city is so attractive for technology companies to come here and do all these conferences?IoT TimesRoger Bou:    Well, that’s a good question, because Barcelona, you know well, has a very nice weather, nice people, good food. But I think the clue is not only this. That also is important, of course, but because it has a lot of talented people, it’s a hub for talent. I think it’s the fifth city in the world where people want to work. So it’s easy to attract talent here to Barcelona, and there’s a hub for talent and for the companies right now. So I think that mobile helped, once the Mobile [World Congress came] here, and started doing their event here year after year, and also the public, private collaboration between the institutions here and the private industry has helped to that. And so now I think we have become a hub for tech companies and for talent, and talent is, I think, the most needed resource for tech companies to success. So if you have the talent, you have the companies here.Roger BouIoT Times:      You are now preparing for this year’s show. Can you mention any technology that will be special this year?IoT TimesRoger Bou:    We’ll have some new technologies. I would mention 5G. A lot of people [are] speaking about 5G nowadays. We have just reached an agreement with Mobile World Capital to deploy here in the show, 5G for solutions in vertical industries. So you will be able to see mobility solutions in the show, autonomous vehicles working with 5G, and also solutions for healthcare and manufacturing, also deployed here during the event. So this is one of the enabling technologies for IoT that will help to develop IoT easier and faster. And we’ll have that, but we also are working very hard on blockchain and decentralized internet, and we’ll have workshops for developers and programmers to get real knowledge here in the show, on how different platforms of blockchain work, and how decentralized internet work, and cybersecurity. So we’re working different technologies, all of them with the same goal that’s helping digitize industries.Roger BouIoT Times:      During the past two-three years, the buzzwords today are artificial intelligence, machine learning, neural networks. How do you see all these technologies working on IoT and the impact of the technology in this ecosystem?IoT TimesRoger Bou:    Well I think that nowadays, most of the IoT solutions, they have also artificial intelligence on them, and it’s applying artificial intelligence on the connectivity, it’s what will give big changes and solutions to the IoT market, because it’s not only about connecting things but giving intelligence to these connections, so it can have intelligent decisions on the input that connections gives to you. And this is what will change really the market now. So I think it’s critical, and that’s why a year ago we adopted this technology in the IoT Solutions World Congress, and we have also the Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Systems Congress inside the IoT. And it’s getting more and more attractive year after year.Roger BouIoT Times:      That’s great. What are your expectations for this year’s show, in terms of attendance and people, companies, etc.?IoT TimesRoger Bou:    Well, if you look at the history year after year, we have more or less doubled in size year after year. And this year, luckily, I would say we’ll be again doubling. Cause if you remember last edition, we were in pavilion number two [of Fira Gran Via], not in all of it, and this year, we have all pavilion number two sold out, ready, and we are working now in pavilion number one, so we’ll have two pavilions working. Probably only IoT will be in pavilion number two, and pavilion number one [will be] about blockchain, the blockchain workshops, the decentralized internet, and cybersecurity, and maybe artificial intelligence.  It depends on how sales of exhibition space goes. So, we have great expectations.Roger BouIoT Times:      Okay, great. Thank you very much. I wish you a very good show.IoT TimesRoger Bou:    Thank you very much. See you there.Roger Bou"

"How IoT, artificial intelligence and edge computing are re-shaping thermal design",https://iot.eetimes.com/how-iot-artificial-intelligence-and-edge-computing-are-re-shaping-thermal-design/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/thermal-management-iot-450x270.jpg,Technology Trends,"May 6, 2019","With the proliferation of connected technologies, design engineers are being pushed to deliver products that are safer, more powerful, and increasingly reliable. A recent concern to crop up has to do with thermal applications – specifically, how the application of thermal analysis is an increasingly important step in the process of designing electronics devices for the IT and data center sectors.Over the next year, new thermal design priorities will largely be driven by technologies related to the internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), edge computing and 5G solutions. In fact, recent research from Future Facilities, which makes thermal design software, reported the following:During a digital roundtable event, thermal designers, engineers, and experts from a variety of organizations — including Facebook, HP Enterprise, QuantaCool, Engineered Fluids, CommScope, Vertiv, 6SigmaET, and Binghamton University — gathered to compare notes. The group identified a handful of thermal design priorities, including:At present, design engineers currently understand the complexity of thermal issues relating to these new technologies. But to improve processes and performances, they need to better understand the nuances. Author Hailey McKeefrey cites the following as an example:To further embolden this point, Ernesto Ferrer, thermal engineer at HP Enterprise is quoted saying: “Both AI and the IoT will drive innovative cooling solutions in the future in order to meet changing thermal demands. Components and systems that were air-cooled will need to use evermore innovative cooling techniques — increasingly liquid cooling, hybrid cooling, and full immersion cooling.”What’s more, engineers are beginning to struggle with the potentially harsher environments that will be present in emerging edge data centers. “Edge computing will mean taking data centers in a telecom-centric direction; this will require a cross-over period between these two industries that tend to cool their systems in completely different ways,” said Tom Craft, director of engineering at CommScope.Read the rest of the story on our sister site EEWeb"
Battery-less IoT could soon be a reality with Bluetooth multi-sensor platform,https://iot.eetimes.com/battery-less-iot-could-soon-be-a-reality-with-bluetooth-multi-sensor-platform/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/on-semi-rs10-450x270.jpg,Technology Trends,"May 2, 2019","ON Semiconductor continues to make significant progress in the company’s development of battery-less and maintenance-free IoT solutions. This is best evidenced by the company’s most recent introduction of the RSL10 Multi-Sensor Platform, which is powered with just a solar cell.This new solution supports the development of IoT sensors using continuous solar energy harvesting to gather and communicate data via Bluetooth® Low Energy, without the need for batteries or other forms of non-renewable energy.From the company’s release:Taking a bit of a closer look, the platform combines the RSL10 SIP with a solar cell and a host of low power sensors from Bosch Sensortec, including the BME280 all-in-one environmental sensor (pressure, temperature, humidity) as well as the BMA400 ultra-low-power 3-axis accelerometer. When combined, developers and manufacturers are able to create complete IoT nodes entirely powered through renewable energy or energy harvested from the sensor’s surroundings.For those wondering where this need comes from, there are a growing number of IoT sensor applications where the duty cycle is low enough to support intermittent communications. This, in turn, allows the energy needed to support operation to be harvested using renewable sources. The energy efficiency of the RSL10, specifically, is augmented by the incredibly efficient power management system and ultra-low-power sensors implemented in the platform.As or applications, the RSL10 Solar Cell Multi-Sensor Platform is expected to be used for smart home and building automation needs like HVAC control, window/door sensors and air quality monitoring. Asset tracking including package open/close detection, shock monitoring, and temperature and humidity data logging are also possible applications.For the developer, it is worth noting that the platform is supplied with all design files (Gerber, schematic and BoM) and customizable source code as part of a CMSIS software package. The RSL10 Solar Cell Multi-Sensor Platform is available now from ON Semiconductor alongside a number of other energy-efficient rapid prototyping platforms for IoT, including the Energy Harvesting Bluetooth Low Energy Switch.Via our sister site IoT-Design-Zone"

While much of the first part of the interview focused on his company’s technical efforts in the space, the following focuses on his outlook for the industry at large.***Continuation of previous interview***IoT Times: Talking about the automotive industry, one of the biggest things is the supply chain. Their supply chain has been built over many years. This morning, you talked about the way that car and vehicle manufacturers are going top down, pushing their supply chains to embrace these new technologies. How is that going to affect in terms of, for example, jobs, and the way that people are working? Because in reality, the supply chains and the supply parks that are near the factories employ more people than the factories themselves.IoT Times:Ramón Pastor: The supply chain, what I was talking about this morning is that when there is a new technology coming, what the big manufacturers do is they qualify themselves the technology. They get comfortable with the technology. They manufacture with this technology to get the knowledge, and once they are convinced, they use their existing supply chain for mass production. It’s not that the big car companies are going to begin to get the business out of tier one or tier two. What they are doing now is getting comfortable, qualifying the technology, making sure that they establish all the processes, the quality control needed, and when they are ready, then they deploy to tier one and tier two suppliers. I don’t think there is going to be a significant change in the next few years in the automotive supply chain because of this. However, it’s true that in between, while they’re qualified, they [the car manufacturers] are producing their own parts themselves.Ramón Pastor:IoT Times: So, all these people in the supply chain, they really need to act quickly, and there will be some that they’re not going to survive?IoT Times:Ramón Pastor:   Absolutely, and that’s a great point. Every new technology opens the door to new players. So the tier one and tier two suppliers need to adapt because if they don’t, there will be other players that take their place for these type of components.Ramón Pastor:IoT Times: You talked about the circular economy, and this is one of the big themes today.  The materials that you’re using which are in general thermoplastics. First of all, they’re using fossil fuels, then to generate those materials, you need to use energy. Moreover, later, you need to recycle them. I’ve seen your machines and the way that they reuse the plastics that are not used at that moment and then go into the next load. But, what happens with the pieces after they’re being used for months, years, whatever? Is there any plan for that?IoT Times:Ramón Pastor:   Two things. First, we’re printing many types of thermoplastics. The other thing about thermoplastics, they’re 100 percent recyclable; that’s a great thing. Today, half of the materials that we offer come from a vegetable source, not fuel.  What we have is a take-back program for the powder that sometimes is not used; although you can recycle 100 percent of the product, sometimes people want to dispose of it. We provide a service to take it back and recondition that powder to be able to use it again. That’s one side. The second side of this is what happens with the part. It is the same for all technologies. So, if the part is in good condition, it will be used. If the part can’t be longer used, it is recycled.Ramón Pastor:IoT Times: Is there anything on working with metals, working with different types of materials that were not available three years ago?IoT Times:Ramón Pastor:  Today, the 3D printers that we offer work for plastic, using the Jet Fusion technology. We announced last year that we are going to the market with a new metal technology called Metal Jet, which is going to be widely available in a couple of years. However, meanwhile, this year, we are starting to offer parts service to customers that want to try our technology, and we’re working with two partners, GKN and Pharmatech, that have big factories, producing for the automotive market and for the healthcare market, and they have begun to produce [metal] parts . We start with stainless steel, but this is only the first of the metals that we will offer in the future.  It’s going to be a different machine, a different technology than Jet Fusion. It shares many technology assets, but are different.Ramón Pastor:GKN Powder Metallurgy and HP Metal Jet functional metal part – Courtesy of HPGKN Powder Metallurgy and HP Metal Jet functional metal part – Courtesy of HPIoT Times: Last year, you gave estimates about TCOs for the use of your machines, and this year, I missed that part. Have there been any changes in economics, any significant changes in the last year, in the performance and the possibilities to use this technology instead of the traditional injection molding?IoT Times:Ramón Pastor: In terms of economics, no. The production models that we showed this year in the show, the Fusion Jet 4200 and 4210, are the same. So in this case, no change. We have introduced a new line, the 500 series, more suitable for prototyping, offering full color, which is a new add-on. That doesn’t mean that we’re not working on continuously improving this year, and we will improve in two areas. One, new products that we’ll introduce in the future, with similar technologies. The second part, we have been working a lot with our customers to improve equipment performance, which at the end is what is the uptime that the machine has, what is the performance that the machine has? What is the part quality percentage? What is the process capability index [CPK]?  So you reduce scrap, and you can improve the economics out of the machine through process control.Ramón Pastor:Did you miss part 1 of our interview with Ramón Pastor?

IoT data monetization: Turn your IoT data into additional revenue,https://iot.eetimes.com/iot-data-monetization-turn-your-iot-data-into-additional-revenue/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/01/story23-450x270.jpg,Technology Trends,"April 25, 2019","When it comes to the internet of things (IoT), most designers tend to focus on the hardware aspect of IoT devices. What modules are featured on the device and how can it be integrated into an overall design to be more efficient? It’s common that IoT devices are used to gather information on the system into which it is being integrated and decide on a course of action based on that data; that’s where it ends in most cases.But what if the data collected can be used for a whole new additional revenue stream for yourself or your company?Monetizing IoT dataMonetizing IoT dataThe concept of turning IoT data into a product to sell to others is an upward trend that companies have been looking at to add an additional revenue stream. Of course, the concept of selling data is nothing new. The production and consumption of information (data) in order to sell it or the buying of information can be called “infonomics,” coined by the information technology research and advisory firm Gartner. The only difference now is that with thousands of smart devices connected and continuously gathering data, there is an untapped market opportunity that many have not taken advantage of with this IoT data.Information is highly valuable and even more so for companies that might want to venture toward a new industry or improve in their current area, but they do not want raw data only, that which was collected from IoT devices. Unorganized data doesn’t mean much by itself, but if the data can be refined and identify patterns, it can take on real value to a person or company.An example of how you can monetize IoT data is if your company (or you) sells a smart device for a specific application and has it monitor useful information, such as energy efficiency or causes of malfunction, it can then turn that IoT data that was gathered through multiple devices in multiple situations and package it into a valuable “product” to sell to supporting manufacturers and service firms to use that data and find ways to improve their product or services. This not only helps reduce the effect of hardware erosion by providing additional revenue but proves how effective your devices can be.Companies have already used the concept of using the data that they collect from their IoT devices to improve their own products and services, meaning that collecting additional data points that are relevant to potential partners is something that they might want to consider adding to their devices.Challenges of monetizing IoT dataChallenges of monetizing IoT dataIn an interview with Doug Laney, Gartner’s chief data officer, Gregory Piatetsky asks about some challenges for organizations in monetizing information. While this interview is a general overview of all types of information, it can easily be applied to IoT data.Data quality: The IoT data that is being collected needs to be high-quality data. It will need to show the accuracy, completeness, integrity, timeliness and more for customers to trust the information being provided.Data quality:Determining types of information: Many companies may want IoT data in different forms that might not have been considered to fit their model. They might want more information on data points that were originally unrecorded. This will require flexibility to deliver these types of requests.Determining types of information:Classic product management/marketing approach: Because IoT data isn’t necessarily a physical product, it can cause some organizations to ignore typical activities that go into selling a physical device. This includes researching, designing, developing, packaging, promoting and supporting physical products or services.Classic product management/marketing approach:Protecting against unintended/unlicensed uses: Data can easily be copied, which can be great for licensing over and over but challenging to ensure against the customer using it in unintended ways. This means that contracts will need to be considered, requiring a licensed user to be trained on “safe and appropriate handling” of information products, enabling usage auditing and more.Protecting against unintended/unlicensed usesThe future of selling IoT dataThe future of selling IoT dataThis practice will continue to grow as more companies can tap into the power that IoT data can provide to others and how much they are willing to obtain that information. The IoT industry is growing, and even Japanese companies are working together to try to launch an IoT data-exchange platform by 2020 to help inspire new products and services.You can find example of companies finding ways to monetize IoT data. Samsung launched a service two years ago that will enable IoT device manufacturers and service providers to monetize IoT data. This allows you to partner up with Samsung and their Artik Cloud and provide ways to monetize the IoT data that it collects and earn revenue shares with devices that get used by third-party apps and services. Of course, this is one “ready-to-go” platform that can be implemented, but the process can be all up to the person.Just remember: Companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft thrive on collecting data and learning new ways to provide solutions. In this day and age of trying to be as efficient as possible, data is as valuable as it has ever been. Maybe that smart water system of yours that keeps track of leaks can be worth much more than you think."
New sensor development kit specially built for BLE radio,https://iot.eetimes.com/new-sensor-development-kit-specially-built-for-ble-radio/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/03/rsl10-sip-450x270.jpg,Technology Trends,"March 11, 2019","Well, this certainly looks to be useful. ON Semiconductor has just announced the launch of its new RSL10 Sensor Development Kit, which was specially designed to provide engineering teams with an intuitive sensor design platform built around the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio.This kit features 9 degrees of freedom (DoF) detection and environmental monitoring devices, including ambient light, pressure, relative humidity, and temperature sensors. It also includes an ultra-low-noise digital microphone, user-programmable RGB LED, three programmable pushbutton switches, and 64 Kb of EEPROM.The design engineer will appreciate the fact that ON Semiconductor’s new kit combines motion and environmental sensing with the ultra-low-power capabilities of the RSL10 Bluetooth 5 system-on-chip (SoC) to facilitate consumer and industrial IoT designs.For those wondering why BLE, it is worth pointing out that by and large the BLE is seen as a standard radio for smart sensor designs built around wireless communications. The RSL10 Bluetooth chip, specifically, comes in a 5.5-mm2 WLCSP, a 6 × 6-mm QFN package, and a system-in-package (SiP) with an integrated antenna.Worth highlighting is the fact that the RSL10 SiP also integrates a range of low-power sensors from Bosch Sensortec. For example, the highly integrated BME680 environmental sensor is used to detect a wide range of gases for air-quality measurements. It also includes the BMM150 geomagnetic sensor and the BHI160 smart sensor for high-accuracy motion sensing.Developers that use the kit will be able to connect to the sensor dev kit to monitor sensors and evaluate features through the RSL10 sense and control mobile application. Its app supports several cloud platforms for uploading the sensor data.Via our sister site Electronic Products"

And one of the more heavily relied upon components in most IoT applications is the sensor.Sensors are used to collect data across a wide range of products, from drones and automobiles to wearables and augmented reality headsets. According a recent study conducted by Newark element14, it is the environmental sensor that is most often used in IoT applications.This begs the obvious question: what is an environmental sensor? To put it succinctly, these components measure things like humidity, temperature and pressure. According to 38% of respondents, they are most often used in IoT designs. Next are motion sensors with 25% of respondents saying they rely on this component to gather data, then opto/image sensors with 19%, followed by health monitoring sensors with 8% and audio sensors at 4%.The survey also asked about the increased role of hardware in IoT design: according to the results, 50% of developers use single board computers like the Raspberry Pi because they’re ready-to-use embedded development platforms. 27% of the group said they prefer to use personal designs and 19% said they use development platforms provided by silicon vendors.Furthermore, 58% of developers prefer to design a complete solution for edge-to-cloud security themselves; this, as opposed to relying on third-party solution providers (which could add some additional costs). While this is certainly a sizeable majority,, some survey respondents said they use third-party providers for edge-to-cloud communications (21%), designing edge devices (18%) and for data center/analytics (18%).Finally, it’s worth pointing out that the most preferred connectivity protocol between edge devices and the cloud is Wi-Fi (66%), according to survey respondents. The surveyors state that this is likely due to Wi-Fi’s long-range connectivity, higher throughput and the latest low-power microprocessors with integrated Wi-Fi on the chip.The second most popular communications protocol is cellular – 4G/LTE (31%), followed by Bluetooth Low Energy (27%), LoRa (11%) and 1 sub-GHz (7%).To learn more, check out the full survey. "

To give you a sample of what was discussed, Dave pointed out to Matt how the IOT industry is now addressing big things like interoperability, security and then posed the question: What does that mean in the context of wireless connectivity and those devices?Matt Johnson’s response:For interoperability and security, specifically, the easy way, at least that I would think about it is, it’s not going to happen unless those things happen. The interoperability is kind of foundational or elemental to having that experience when people purchase something or put something together, it needs to work. And that’s actually still a major challenge and opportunity that’s out there in the industry. It’s one of the things we really loved about Z-Wave and our acquisition there, because Z-Wave’s really focused on, first and foremost, interoperability. And they already have two or three thousand products that are certified and guaranteed to work together, which is huge. On the security side, I don’t think you have to debate or convince anyone how important that is. But one thing that’s really exciting to us, in the first half of this year, Silicon Labs is going to be announcing what we call our Series Two or next generation of IOT products. So we have a platform that we do every generation, and in this new generation, we’ve really pushed the bar… raised the bar or pushed the envelope on security. So hardware-level, chip-level. And it’s going to allow user authentication, it’s going to allow IP protection, consumer data protection. Because one of the things that could really derail this is if the security isn’t what it needs to be. You can imagine all the scenarios, and some we can’t even imagine, about how this could go wrong. So I’m proud that we’ve been pretty proactive in investing in security before it was even a big deal.For interoperability and security, specifically, the easy way, at least that I would think about it is, it’s not going to happen unless those things happen.

Per the company, this new cellular IoT module offers more security features than similar modules in the market today. That’s because the nRF9160 features both Arm’s TrustZone as well as CryptoCell security.As if that’s not impressive enough, the nRF9160 System-in-Package (SiP) is drop-in–ready with GCF, FCC, and CE certifications, enabling deployment in cellular networks and cellular IoT products worldwide.Per author Heather Hamilton:In its announcement, Nordic explained that it partnered with Qorvo to achieve a SiP that looks closer to an integrated chip than a module, leveraging Qorvo’s RF front end, advanced packaging, and MicroShield technology. The module is designed to support global operation with a single SiP variant thanks to Nordic’s multimode LTE-M/NB-IoT modem, SAW-less transceiver, and Qorvo’s custom RF front-end solution.The nRF9160 is the first IoT module to use Arm’s Cortex M-33 CPU core and is supported by 1 MB of Flash and 256 kB of RAM on-board memory. Other features include a broad range peripheral set, analog and digital interfaces, 32 GPIOs, a standalone modem with full LTE capability, and a multi-band RF front end.Also worth pointing out: The nRF9160 SiP also has integrated GPS support, which allows both GPS and cellular data to be used for more accurate positioning, said the company.For those curious, the new IoT module is supported by a development kit, SiP module samples, LTE-M firmware, and an SDK with an application example for cloud connectivity. Its meant to help engineers get a jumpstart with sensor-to-cloud IoT applications. Its also meant to serve as a quick, go-to resource for accessing Nordic’s cloud-based nRF Connect for Cloud management tool, PC-based nRF Connect for Desktop tool, and Segger Embedded Studio.At the moment, NB-IoT and GPS functionality is in limited sampling and will be available for evaluation through firmware updates in the first quarter of 2019.Via our sister site Electronic Products"

Per the International Telecommunication Union, the world produces approximately 45 million tons of electronic waste (e-waste) each year. And that number is expected to continue rising.You see, when the useful life of an electronic device comes to an end, how to properly dispose of it is a challenge. Electronic devices contain toxic components, which can be harmful to the environment. What’s more, because these devices often contain personal and proprietary data, improperly disposing of them also leaves sensitive data open to exploitation. As the average cost of a data breach continues to rise (according to IBM it is nearing $4 million), this is a growing problem as well.To address this issue head-on, the StEP Initiative was launched by the United Nations; however, more needs to be done to ensure the safety and well-begin of today’s global population as well as future generations to come.Right now, there are four worthwhile solutions to this issue:When an electronic device can’t be reused as a whole entity, it’s possible that some of its components might be safely recovered. Otherwise, the device can be recycled according to best-practice industry standards.But before we get to any of these steps, identifying and properly disposing of IoT devices requires a transparent, robust ITAD process. Thorough, certified data sanitization that is performed to accepted industry standards is the first step in sustainable technology management. And there are a few companies out there that can capably perform this service.Read the full story on our sister site EETimes"

As such, organizations will need to understand the risks and opportunities related to data broking and set appropriate IT policies in place.3: IoT Governance3: IoT GovernanceAs the IoT grows, the need for a governance framework that ensures appropriate behavior in the creation, storage, use and deletion of information related to IoT technologies will become increasingly important. This ranges from simple technical tasks to more complex issues—and everything in between.4: New Wireless Networking Technologies for IoT4: New Wireless Networking Technologies for IoTIoT networking involves balancing a set of competing requirements like endpoint cost, power consumption, bandwidth and more. While no single networking technology optimizes all of these yet, new IoT networking technologies will soon provide even more choice and flexibility. In particular network technologies like 5G, the forthcoming generation of low earth orbit satellites, and backscatter networks could be explored further.5: Novel IoT User Experiences5: Novel IoT User ExperiencesThe IoT user experience (UX) will be driven by four factors: New sensors, new algorithms, new experience architectures and context, and socially aware experiences. With an increasing number of interactions occurring with things that don’t have screens and keyboards, organizations’ UX designers will be required to use new technologies and adopt new perspectives if they want to create a superior UX.6: Sensor Innovation6: Sensor InnovationThe sensor market will continue to mature through 2023: New sensors will enable a wider range of events to be detected, current sensors will reduce in price or be packaged in new ways to support new applications and new algorithms will emerge to gather even more information.7: Shift from Intelligent Edge to Intelligent Mesh7: Shift from Intelligent Edge to Intelligent MeshThe move from centralized and cloud to edge architectures is already under way in the IoT space; however, this is not the end point. That’s because the set of layers associated with edge architecture will evolve to a more unstructured architecture comprising of a wide range of “things” and services connected in a dynamic mesh which, in turn, will enable more flexible, intelligent and responsive IoT systems.8: Silicon Chip Innovation8: Silicon Chip InnovationGartner states that while the majority of current IoT endpoint devices use conventional processor chips, traditional instruction sets and memory architectures aren’t well-suited to all the tasks that endpoints need to perform. As such, the research firm expects that by 2023, new special-purpose chips will reduce the power consumption required to run a DNN, enabling new edge architectures and embedded DNN functions in low-power IoT endpoints to support new capabilities such as data analytics integrated with sensors, and speech recognition included in low cost battery-powered devices.9: Social, Legal and Ethical IoT9: Social, Legal and Ethical IoTAs the IoT becomes more widely deployed, a range of social, legal and ethical issues will grow in importance, including ownership of data and the deductions made from it; algorithmic bias; privacy; and compliance with regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation.10: Trusted Hardware and Operating System10: Trusted Hardware and Operating SystemBy 2023, Gartner expects to see the deployment of hardware and software combinations that together create more trustworthy and secure IoT systems. This will come about as the result of organizations currently not having control over the source and nature of the software and hardware being utilized in IoT initiatives.Read the full story on our sister site EETimes"
"To comply with GDPR, most data should remain at the edge",https://iot.eetimes.com/to-comply-with-gdpr-most-data-should-remain-at-the-edge/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/10/gdpr-3518254_1920-450x270.jpg,Technology Trends,"October 31, 2018","Barcelona–If there has been a theme capturing the attention of technology conferences’ attendees over the past two years, it would be GDPR.Barcelona–It doesn’t matter if the conversation is about wearables, 5G networks, Edge computing, payment systems, CCTV, or transit cards, at some point in the discussion the renowned four-letter acronym pops up. The recent IoT Solutions World Congress was no exception. During the session IoT, data and AI  as key levers of digital transformation,  Patrice Slupowski. Senior Vice-President Digital Innovation at Orange, argued that GDPR compliance is one the most challenging issues companies are facing when implementing IoT technologies.Slupowski praised the new regulation as the building stone to protect citizens from the dangers of data profiling and discrimination by algorithms.During his recent speech at the European Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners, Apple’s CEO Tim Cook praised the GDPR as an example that other governments should follow.“This year, you’ve shown the world that good policy and political will can come together to protect the rights of everyone. We should celebrate the transformative work of the European institutions tasked with the successful implementation of the GDPR…. It is time for the rest of the world, including my home country, to follow your lead.” Cook said.Worldwide, close to 8,000 new devices connect to the Internet every minute, 345 million per month, which will grow to an expected 50 billion by 2020. All these devices are designed to collect and transmit data.For example, most households in Europe and the US already have one connected device (wanted or not): the smart meter. Whether for electricity, gas, or water, smart meters collect thousands of data points per month, and sometimes every day.  smart meterThat data, attached to the resident’s account number, can be used to help the user choose a better service plan, adjust consumption, and improve the utility company’s forecast of the area demands. The same data, however, can also be used to determine the resident’s behavior, when the house or apartment is empty, what appliances are in use and, in some cases, how many people are on the premises. All of that without WiFi or any other internet connection service present in the house. Other examples include the increasing number of appliances on the market that are equipped with “smart features.” Smart TVs, refrigerators, washing machines, thermostats, etc. all these appliances, connected to the cloud via our WiFi and mobile apps, continuously send information about our habits, including what TV programs we watch, the food we buy, the clothes we wash and, obviously, the time we spend at home.Tim Cook was adamant about the dangers of over-collecting data: “These scraps of data, each one harmless enough on its own, are carefully assembled, synthesized, traded, and sold. Taken to its extreme, this process creates an enduring digital profile, and lets companies know you better than you may know yourself…. We shouldn’t sugarcoat the consequences: This is surveillance, and these stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich the companies that collect them.” This is surveillanceThe GDPR is explicit: Data collected should be used only to provide the service or services that users signed up for. The only exception that doesn’t require explicit user consent is data needed to comply with government regulations.Otherwise, any company collecting data requires opt-in consent from the user or customer. And a customer’s refusal to opt-in cannot be used to deny access to the product or service.That’s why it is essential to implement privacy-by-design and keep raw collected data at the edge.Going back to the smart meter example: It is legal for a utility company to aggregate the data collected by hundreds of smart meters in one area (i.e., a city block) using a local gateway, and continuously send that aggregated data to their data centers, as long as it doesn’t include any individual metering. That helps the company manage the grid, forecast electricity use, and detect any problems or fraud in the area without invading individual privacy.Obviously, at the end of every billing cycle, the utility company needs to collect the total consumption of each home, but it will not have insight into the habits of individual customers.The GDPR and similar regulations appearing in countries such as Brazil and Singapore, are here to stay. Some companies are being investigated, and there are countries already filing cases against large corporations.We need corporations to take the letter and spirit of privacy regulations such as GDPR seriously, ensuring that privacy is respected and also helping people to trust adopting new technologies.

We expect to be the biggest IoT event of the year with over 14,000 attendees.Additionally, on the exhibition floor, we have increased the number of exhibitors, and exhibition space, 30% over last year. Companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Huawei, are coming back with a more substantial presence, both at the exhibition and at the Congress.One fact that shows the importance of the IoTSWC is that many companies are planning to make several product announcements during the show.Blockchain is becoming one of the most critical technologies for digital transformation, and AI is adding the intelligence layer to IoT. Many industrial IoT offerings are starting to add such techniques in addition to edge and cloud computing, to leverage the full power of big data and the information collected by IoT devices. Blockchain enables services such as securing the supply chain and predictive maintenance.This year the testbed area will have a premium location in the exhibition area, right in front of the entrance, in the middle of the Pavillion. We are going to have new, exciting testbeds and case studies featured at the show.One example is Emergency One, the UK’s leading manufacturer of Fire, Rescue and Emergency Vehicles, which use Vodafone IoT to connect fire engines for improved safety and efficiency.Another compelling use case is coming from Alaska, where they are using IoT technology for the protection of Beluga whales. Aridea Solutions (West Virginia) was tasked to design a solution to monitor a natural gas leak that was detected approximately 6 kilometers offshore in the Cook Inlet, where only around 300 to 400 Beluga whales live.  Aridea designed a buoy equipped with a special wireless sensor platform to monitor air and water near the leak affecting the Beluga whales and other aquatic mammals. The sensors are providing crucial data for analyzing the environmental impacts of the leak until repairs are completed.There will be some special events organized by some of the exhibitors that will take place before and during the show. One example is Microsoft’s IoT in Action, a one day conference with the top executives of the firm on intelligent edge, cloud, and IoT security.The most important parallel conference for me, however, will be Women Leadership on IoT, taking place on Oct. 16th, where inspirational women leaders in Industrial IoT representing established corporations will offer their perspectives on integrating gender equality into the digital transformation movement.IoT Times is a Global Media Partner of the IoT Solutions World Congress and we will be covering the most important events and talks during the show.IoT Times is a Global Media Partner of the IoT Solutions World Congress and we will be covering the most important events and talks during the show."

The company is reportedly in the final stages of acquiring Mountain View, Calif.-based data analytics firm Treasure Data for $600 million. This comes on the heels of its acquisition in June of Stream Technologies, a unified connectivity management platform for IoT devices, and its investment in San Jose-based SWIM.ai.News of this latest acquisition comes from people close to the deal. It also comes prior to the company’s planned “major IoT announcement” on August 7.While nothing is official, author Nitin Dahad speculates on what this (supposed) acquisition means:When it comes to Arm, it seems like those in charge have recognized that the route to profitability has to be this bigger ecosystem sell, and hence, the acquisition strategy would make sense.For instance, the acquisition of Stream provides the physical connectivity platform for IoT networks covering several wireless protocols. At the time of acquisition, it is said to have been maintaining 770,000 managed subscribers and handling 2 TB of traffic per day. Stream provides companies with the ability to deploy an IoT device, find a network, self-authenticate, automatically provision, and connect to the lowest-cost channel, removing the need to interface with multiple different network systems and develop several business contracts for the network connectivity.When the acquisition was announced, Arm said that, together with its Mbed IoT device management platform, the combination will provide organizations with a scalable end-to-end IoT platform for managing, connecting, provisioning and updating devices. In addition, Stream is also expected to work with mobile industry association GSMA to create compliant embedded subscriber identity module (eSIM) solutions to ensure secure identity and optimal connectivity for IoT devices from the chip to the cloud.As for Treasure Data — whose customers include SoftBank, the owner of Arm — the company already provides data analytics solutions for automotive and IoT for firms like Pioneer, Mitsubishi, and Subaru. One of the company’s biggest selling points is its ability to ingest data from any connected device or machine, correlate data from multiple sources, and leverage machine learning to enable customers to act on the insights provided. It was founded by three Japanese entrepreneurs in California in 2011 and has received over $54 million in funding to date.Read the full story on our sister site EETimes"

Stream acquired by Arm to help expand IoT services,https://iot.eetimes.com/stream-acquired-by-arm-to-help-expand-iot-services/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/06/ARM-iot-services-450x270.jpg,Technology Trends,"June 13, 2018","Arm recently acquired Stream Technologies (Glasgow). The purpose behind the purchase, if you will, is to grow a business in paid services for devices on the Internet of Things. This unique move comes as the IoT is still in an early stage but widely seen to have huge potential with services expected to be one of its hottest sectors.For those unfamiliar, Stream, a private company founded in 2000, is widely known for its connectivity management software and services. At present, they are used by 770,000 devices carrying 2 terabytes of traffic daily. While the company is mainly focused on cellular, its offerings are network-agnostic; that is, it also supports LoRa and satellite nets carrying IP and non-IP data.Stream serves a wide variety of applications including asset tracking, smart meters, and the U.K.’s National Rail system. Its services include support for billing and the so-called embedded subscriber identity module (eSIM), a software-based cellular ID. Worth noting is that earlier this year, Arm rolled out software that it called Kigen OS to enable eSIM on its cores.Arm plans to integrate Stream’s products into its nascent Mbed IoT services. The company did not disclose how much it paid for Stream, the size of Stream’s revenues, or the size of its own nascent IoT services business.The acquisition is an example of how Arm is reaching beyond the processor core sector that it dominates with help from its new owner, Softbank. Arm already works with IBM to connect IoT deployments to the IBM Watson Cloud and plans other such deals.Hima Mukkamala, general manager of Arm’s IoT Cloud Services group, has a very optimistic outlook now that the deal is final.IoT services are “the carrot that everyone chases,” said Christopher Rommel, vice president of embedded research at market watcher VDC Research Group, Inc.Arm is growing a portfolio of IoT services around device connectivity and management.

Author Vivek Joshi, who is also CEO & Founder of Entytle, explains:Joshi’s answer: data science.He points out that the one question most manufacturers are asking every day is how can we leverage customer data (things like orders, service records, call center logs, sales opportunities) across a variety of system (like CRM, warranties, service contracts, etc…) to extract patterns of customer behavior and usage to predict customer needs?Naturally, this opens up several avenues of additional questions:How can these companies get better at predicting the health of drifted customers?How do they increase the linkage rate of customers so more assets are under contract?How do they ultimately improve the connect rate for our customers, so they can drive top-line revenue by recovering lost wallet share?Data science is able to provide answers to most of these questions. AI-driven platforms are helping B2B manufacturers harness the power of their historical and new customer data to increase installed base visibility, identify patterns and predict customer service and sales needs. Ultimately, it’s up to a company’s service, marketing and sales team to do something with these insights: which means that a certain degree of change management needs to happen too.Companies that embrace this approach are beginning to transform their aftermarket approach from being reactive to proactive. They are improving their connectivity with customers and as a result, are driving better outcomes for their customers.And all of this is improving the outlook for IoT and IIoT.Read the full story on our sister site EBNonline"

Will diversity in IoT market challenge ROI?,https://iot.eetimes.com/will-diversity-in-iot-market-challenge-roi/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/LPWA-operators-450x270.png,Technology Trends,"April 9, 2018","The Internet of Things (IoT) will to continue to grow in the years to come – the question, though, is how quickly and what sort of return investors will see when committing to a technology or solution. You see, market fragmentation has made it difficult to find actual, worthwhile return on investment (ROI).“It’s not just one product like a smartphone, its hundreds of different products, and the trick is creating enough products to meet demand,” said Mareca Hatler, director of research for ON World Inc.A recent report on low power wide area (LPWA) networks said that while expected revenues for LPWA systems and services will reach $56 billion by 2022, market fragmentation will wind up spreading this revenue across more than 40 unique IoT applications just for LPWA nets alone.ON World’s latest report projects the Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) version of LTE and the 900 MHz LoRa network will take leading roles in LPWA over the next few years. One of their chief rivals, Sigfox, will trail, in part a victim of the demand for unique designs.“Sigfox has millions of subscriber devices, but its challenge is getting enough devices to meet demand — it’s a product availability problem,” Hatler explained.The problem of needing to customize designs for IoT deployments is a challenge all vendors face; however, some feel it more than others.“One advantage for LoRa is it has a bigger ecosystem with more products. There are dozens of LoRa modules and gateways, Sigfox has a handful,” Hatler said.Unlicensed LPWA networks dominate today, but cellular IoT is coming on strong and apps are expanding. (Image: ON World)Unlicensed LPWA networks dominate today, but cellular IoT is coming on strong and apps are expanding. (Image: ON World)Author Rick Merritt points out that as of today, nearly two thirds of LPWA network operators are unlicensed ones such as LoRa and Sigfox, but cellular carriers are ramping their NB-IoT plans quickly. This will result in NB-IoT eventually making up more than half of the 1.3 billion LPWA nodes OnWorld forecasts will be deployed by 2025.“NB-IoT has the advantage in the next five to seven years. The question is only how fast it will happen. The network operators have so much scale they can offer disruptive pricing,” Hatler said, noting Deutsche Telecom will charge just $12 per NB-IoT node for ten years or 500 MBytes.Carriers are expected to drive wide availability as well as price. They can also offer good quality of service and as much as 5x more bandwidth than unlicensed LPWA nets, Hatler explained.Carriers in China have been quick to jump on NB-IoT. U.S. carriers rolled out a higher bandwidth LTE-M option first because it only required a software upgrade to their LTE networks. But in the last several months they have announced aggressive plans for NB-IoT, which typically requires carriers install some new hardware.Read the full story on our sister site EETimes"
What’s driving the rapid rise of edge computing?,https://iot.eetimes.com/whats-driving-the-rapid-rise-of-edge-computing/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/01/story17-450x270.jpg,Technology Trends,"March 29, 2018","The practice of edge computing within the Internet of Things (IoT) space is creating a bevy of new opportunities for embedded designers.It’s quickly being discovered that FPGAs can be used to better aggregate data. What’s more, once they’re in place, the technology can also process that data quickly and deliver real-time analytics. When coupled with DSP and multicore processors, intelligent nodes and gateways can all provide information that is significantly more useful back to the cloud, thereby reducing power consumption and extending battery life.Author Mark Patrick, in a cover story for Embedded World 2018, details the rise of edge computing in a technical article. From the paper’s introduction:Through the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), there has been significant interest generated in edge computing. Like Cisco fog computing, this means putting more processing power at the edge of the cloud, which helps to reduce the overall power consumption from the sensor node to the data centre. This represents a significant opportunity for embedded designers, who are demanding more sophisticated algorithms at the sensor and the gateway. While there has been considerable activity over the last few years in apps and software to support data centre hardware, the move to edge computing will need a much broader base of software, running on higher performance embedded systems.Hardware is becoming available in both the embedded and industrial markets that will address this. It generally utilises dual or quadcore processors, such as the KeyStone system on-a-chip offering from Texas Instruments at the nodes and Intel Corei7 in gateways from suppliers like ADLINK that are capable of handling both the sensor data and the analytics. This will be essential with tens of billions of IoT devices expected to connect to the network. Current IoT architectures tend to only deploy analytics in a data centre context once all the information has been collected, but as IoT deployments increase, data will simply not be provided quickly enough. To be truly useful, analytics will really need to be placed at the true edge, directly into the devices. “The situation we have at the moment is that data is being sent to a massive data lake where it is not being used,” said Chad Boulanger, Global VP of Business Development for IoT Analytics at software development company Greenwave Systems. “As the IoT continues to grow, this is not going to add value. The only way to do that is to do as much as possible at the true edge of networks – within the actual devices – so that the machine knows that something is wrong right there and can take appropriate action. If the data has to travel from another part of the network, that could have a detrimental impact.”Read the full article on our sister site Internet of Things Design Zone"

IoT Times is a Global Media Partner of the show, and we will be there to cover it from start to finish.Roger Bou is the Director of the IoT Congress, and the Technology Business Director of Fira Barcelona, the city’s fairs organization. He holds an MBA from ESADE Business School.We talked to Bou about this year’s show, the impact of 5G and AI in industrial IoT, and why Barcelona is attracting talent and companies in the IT industry.You can watch our interview with Roger Bou below. A full transcript of the interview follows the clip.IoT Times:      We are here with Roger Bou, Director of the IoT Solutions World Congress in Barcelona, and we are going to talk about this year’s show. Good afternoon, Roger. How are you doing?IoT TimesRoger Bou:    Hi, Pablo. How are you?Roger BouIoT Times:      This year will mark the fifth edition of the show. What do you think has changed in the IoT market during the past five years?IoT TimesRoger Bou:    Well, many things have changed during the past five years. If you remember, five years ago, people used to talk about M2M, not even about IoT. And I can remember clearly the first edition of the IoT [World Congress], that companies came here, and they didn’t have real solutions for IoT. They just were expecting a big growth of the market, and they wanted to be part of it in the future, but they didn’t really know what kind of solutions would these connective things develop for each of the industries now. And if you look now, you can see a solution for each of the vertical industries. In fact, this year, in this edition, you will see solutions that will impact very deep in the energy industry, in the healthcare industry, in the manufacturing industry, and not only in predictive maintenance or increasing productivity but also in the way they relate with their customers, and getting customer satisfaction with their solutions. So things have changed deeply, from just an expectation, to thinking of this will change the world, and have a big opportunity to deliver real solutions implemented in the market.Roger BouIoT Times:      That’s great. Why do you think Barcelona as a city is so attractive for technology companies to come here and do all these conferences?IoT TimesRoger Bou:    Well, that’s a good question, because Barcelona, you know well, has a very nice weather, nice people, good food. But I think the clue is not only this. That also is important, of course, but because it has a lot of talented people, it’s a hub for talent. I think it’s the fifth city in the world where people want to work. So it’s easy to attract talent here to Barcelona, and there’s a hub for talent and for the companies right now. So I think that mobile helped, once the Mobile [World Congress came] here, and started doing their event here year after year, and also the public, private collaboration between the institutions here and the private industry has helped to that. And so now I think we have become a hub for tech companies and for talent, and talent is, I think, the most needed resource for tech companies to success. So if you have the talent, you have the companies here.Roger BouIoT Times:      You are now preparing for this year’s show. Can you mention any technology that will be special this year?IoT TimesRoger Bou:    We’ll have some new technologies. I would mention 5G. A lot of people [are] speaking about 5G nowadays. We have just reached an agreement with Mobile World Capital to deploy here in the show, 5G for solutions in vertical industries. So you will be able to see mobility solutions in the show, autonomous vehicles working with 5G, and also solutions for healthcare and manufacturing, also deployed here during the event. So this is one of the enabling technologies for IoT that will help to develop IoT easier and faster. And we’ll have that, but we also are working very hard on blockchain and decentralized internet, and we’ll have workshops for developers and programmers to get real knowledge here in the show, on how different platforms of blockchain work, and how decentralized internet work, and cybersecurity. So we’re working different technologies, all of them with the same goal that’s helping digitize industries.Roger BouIoT Times:      During the past two-three years, the buzzwords today are artificial intelligence, machine learning, neural networks. How do you see all these technologies working on IoT and the impact of the technology in this ecosystem?IoT TimesRoger Bou:    Well I think that nowadays, most of the IoT solutions, they have also artificial intelligence on them, and it’s applying artificial intelligence on the connectivity, it’s what will give big changes and solutions to the IoT market, because it’s not only about connecting things but giving intelligence to these connections, so it can have intelligent decisions on the input that connections gives to you. And this is what will change really the market now. So I think it’s critical, and that’s why a year ago we adopted this technology in the IoT Solutions World Congress, and we have also the Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Systems Congress inside the IoT. And it’s getting more and more attractive year after year.Roger BouIoT Times:      That’s great. What are your expectations for this year’s show, in terms of attendance and people, companies, etc.?IoT TimesRoger Bou:    Well, if you look at the history year after year, we have more or less doubled in size year after year. And this year, luckily, I would say we’ll be again doubling. Cause if you remember last edition, we were in pavilion number two [of Fira Gran Via], not in all of it, and this year, we have all pavilion number two sold out, ready, and we are working now in pavilion number one, so we’ll have two pavilions working. Probably only IoT will be in pavilion number two, and pavilion number one [will be] about blockchain, the blockchain workshops, the decentralized internet, and cybersecurity, and maybe artificial intelligence.  It depends on how sales of exhibition space goes. So, we have great expectations.Roger BouIoT Times:      Okay, great. Thank you very much. I wish you a very good show.IoT TimesRoger Bou:    Thank you very much. See you there.Roger Bou"

"How IoT, artificial intelligence and edge computing are re-shaping thermal design",https://iot.eetimes.com/how-iot-artificial-intelligence-and-edge-computing-are-re-shaping-thermal-design/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/thermal-management-iot-450x270.jpg,Technology Trends,"May 6, 2019","With the proliferation of connected technologies, design engineers are being pushed to deliver products that are safer, more powerful, and increasingly reliable. A recent concern to crop up has to do with thermal applications – specifically, how the application of thermal analysis is an increasingly important step in the process of designing electronics devices for the IT and data center sectors.Over the next year, new thermal design priorities will largely be driven by technologies related to the internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), edge computing and 5G solutions. In fact, recent research from Future Facilities, which makes thermal design software, reported the following:During a digital roundtable event, thermal designers, engineers, and experts from a variety of organizations — including Facebook, HP Enterprise, QuantaCool, Engineered Fluids, CommScope, Vertiv, 6SigmaET, and Binghamton University — gathered to compare notes. The group identified a handful of thermal design priorities, including:At present, design engineers currently understand the complexity of thermal issues relating to these new technologies. But to improve processes and performances, they need to better understand the nuances. Author Hailey McKeefrey cites the following as an example:To further embolden this point, Ernesto Ferrer, thermal engineer at HP Enterprise is quoted saying: “Both AI and the IoT will drive innovative cooling solutions in the future in order to meet changing thermal demands. Components and systems that were air-cooled will need to use evermore innovative cooling techniques — increasingly liquid cooling, hybrid cooling, and full immersion cooling.”What’s more, engineers are beginning to struggle with the potentially harsher environments that will be present in emerging edge data centers. “Edge computing will mean taking data centers in a telecom-centric direction; this will require a cross-over period between these two industries that tend to cool their systems in completely different ways,” said Tom Craft, director of engineering at CommScope.Read the rest of the story on our sister site EEWeb"
Battery-less IoT could soon be a reality with Bluetooth multi-sensor platform,https://iot.eetimes.com/battery-less-iot-could-soon-be-a-reality-with-bluetooth-multi-sensor-platform/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/on-semi-rs10-450x270.jpg,Technology Trends,"May 2, 2019","ON Semiconductor continues to make significant progress in the company’s development of battery-less and maintenance-free IoT solutions. This is best evidenced by the company’s most recent introduction of the RSL10 Multi-Sensor Platform, which is powered with just a solar cell.This new solution supports the development of IoT sensors using continuous solar energy harvesting to gather and communicate data via Bluetooth® Low Energy, without the need for batteries or other forms of non-renewable energy.From the company’s release:Taking a bit of a closer look, the platform combines the RSL10 SIP with a solar cell and a host of low power sensors from Bosch Sensortec, including the BME280 all-in-one environmental sensor (pressure, temperature, humidity) as well as the BMA400 ultra-low-power 3-axis accelerometer. When combined, developers and manufacturers are able to create complete IoT nodes entirely powered through renewable energy or energy harvested from the sensor’s surroundings.For those wondering where this need comes from, there are a growing number of IoT sensor applications where the duty cycle is low enough to support intermittent communications. This, in turn, allows the energy needed to support operation to be harvested using renewable sources. The energy efficiency of the RSL10, specifically, is augmented by the incredibly efficient power management system and ultra-low-power sensors implemented in the platform.As or applications, the RSL10 Solar Cell Multi-Sensor Platform is expected to be used for smart home and building automation needs like HVAC control, window/door sensors and air quality monitoring. Asset tracking including package open/close detection, shock monitoring, and temperature and humidity data logging are also possible applications.For the developer, it is worth noting that the platform is supplied with all design files (Gerber, schematic and BoM) and customizable source code as part of a CMSIS software package. The RSL10 Solar Cell Multi-Sensor Platform is available now from ON Semiconductor alongside a number of other energy-efficient rapid prototyping platforms for IoT, including the Energy Harvesting Bluetooth Low Energy Switch.Via our sister site IoT-Design-Zone"

While much of the first part of the interview focused on his company’s technical efforts in the space, the following focuses on his outlook for the industry at large.***Continuation of previous interview***IoT Times: Talking about the automotive industry, one of the biggest things is the supply chain. Their supply chain has been built over many years. This morning, you talked about the way that car and vehicle manufacturers are going top down, pushing their supply chains to embrace these new technologies. How is that going to affect in terms of, for example, jobs, and the way that people are working? Because in reality, the supply chains and the supply parks that are near the factories employ more people than the factories themselves.IoT Times:Ramón Pastor: The supply chain, what I was talking about this morning is that when there is a new technology coming, what the big manufacturers do is they qualify themselves the technology. They get comfortable with the technology. They manufacture with this technology to get the knowledge, and once they are convinced, they use their existing supply chain for mass production. It’s not that the big car companies are going to begin to get the business out of tier one or tier two. What they are doing now is getting comfortable, qualifying the technology, making sure that they establish all the processes, the quality control needed, and when they are ready, then they deploy to tier one and tier two suppliers. I don’t think there is going to be a significant change in the next few years in the automotive supply chain because of this. However, it’s true that in between, while they’re qualified, they [the car manufacturers] are producing their own parts themselves.Ramón Pastor:IoT Times: So, all these people in the supply chain, they really need to act quickly, and there will be some that they’re not going to survive?IoT Times:Ramón Pastor:   Absolutely, and that’s a great point. Every new technology opens the door to new players. So the tier one and tier two suppliers need to adapt because if they don’t, there will be other players that take their place for these type of components.Ramón Pastor:IoT Times: You talked about the circular economy, and this is one of the big themes today.  The materials that you’re using which are in general thermoplastics. First of all, they’re using fossil fuels, then to generate those materials, you need to use energy. Moreover, later, you need to recycle them. I’ve seen your machines and the way that they reuse the plastics that are not used at that moment and then go into the next load. But, what happens with the pieces after they’re being used for months, years, whatever? Is there any plan for that?IoT Times:Ramón Pastor:   Two things. First, we’re printing many types of thermoplastics. The other thing about thermoplastics, they’re 100 percent recyclable; that’s a great thing. Today, half of the materials that we offer come from a vegetable source, not fuel.  What we have is a take-back program for the powder that sometimes is not used; although you can recycle 100 percent of the product, sometimes people want to dispose of it. We provide a service to take it back and recondition that powder to be able to use it again. That’s one side. The second side of this is what happens with the part. It is the same for all technologies. So, if the part is in good condition, it will be used. If the part can’t be longer used, it is recycled.Ramón Pastor:IoT Times: Is there anything on working with metals, working with different types of materials that were not available three years ago?IoT Times:Ramón Pastor:  Today, the 3D printers that we offer work for plastic, using the Jet Fusion technology. We announced last year that we are going to the market with a new metal technology called Metal Jet, which is going to be widely available in a couple of years. However, meanwhile, this year, we are starting to offer parts service to customers that want to try our technology, and we’re working with two partners, GKN and Pharmatech, that have big factories, producing for the automotive market and for the healthcare market, and they have begun to produce [metal] parts . We start with stainless steel, but this is only the first of the metals that we will offer in the future.  It’s going to be a different machine, a different technology than Jet Fusion. It shares many technology assets, but are different.Ramón Pastor:GKN Powder Metallurgy and HP Metal Jet functional metal part – Courtesy of HPGKN Powder Metallurgy and HP Metal Jet functional metal part – Courtesy of HPIoT Times: Last year, you gave estimates about TCOs for the use of your machines, and this year, I missed that part. Have there been any changes in economics, any significant changes in the last year, in the performance and the possibilities to use this technology instead of the traditional injection molding?IoT Times:Ramón Pastor: In terms of economics, no. The production models that we showed this year in the show, the Fusion Jet 4200 and 4210, are the same. So in this case, no change. We have introduced a new line, the 500 series, more suitable for prototyping, offering full color, which is a new add-on. That doesn’t mean that we’re not working on continuously improving this year, and we will improve in two areas. One, new products that we’ll introduce in the future, with similar technologies. The second part, we have been working a lot with our customers to improve equipment performance, which at the end is what is the uptime that the machine has, what is the performance that the machine has? What is the part quality percentage? What is the process capability index [CPK]?  So you reduce scrap, and you can improve the economics out of the machine through process control.Ramón Pastor:Did you miss part 1 of our interview with Ramón Pastor?

IoT data monetization: Turn your IoT data into additional revenue,https://iot.eetimes.com/iot-data-monetization-turn-your-iot-data-into-additional-revenue/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/01/story23-450x270.jpg,Technology Trends,"April 25, 2019","When it comes to the internet of things (IoT), most designers tend to focus on the hardware aspect of IoT devices. What modules are featured on the device and how can it be integrated into an overall design to be more efficient? It’s common that IoT devices are used to gather information on the system into which it is being integrated and decide on a course of action based on that data; that’s where it ends in most cases.But what if the data collected can be used for a whole new additional revenue stream for yourself or your company?Monetizing IoT dataMonetizing IoT dataThe concept of turning IoT data into a product to sell to others is an upward trend that companies have been looking at to add an additional revenue stream. Of course, the concept of selling data is nothing new. The production and consumption of information (data) in order to sell it or the buying of information can be called “infonomics,” coined by the information technology research and advisory firm Gartner. The only difference now is that with thousands of smart devices connected and continuously gathering data, there is an untapped market opportunity that many have not taken advantage of with this IoT data.Information is highly valuable and even more so for companies that might want to venture toward a new industry or improve in their current area, but they do not want raw data only, that which was collected from IoT devices. Unorganized data doesn’t mean much by itself, but if the data can be refined and identify patterns, it can take on real value to a person or company.An example of how you can monetize IoT data is if your company (or you) sells a smart device for a specific application and has it monitor useful information, such as energy efficiency or causes of malfunction, it can then turn that IoT data that was gathered through multiple devices in multiple situations and package it into a valuable “product” to sell to supporting manufacturers and service firms to use that data and find ways to improve their product or services. This not only helps reduce the effect of hardware erosion by providing additional revenue but proves how effective your devices can be.Companies have already used the concept of using the data that they collect from their IoT devices to improve their own products and services, meaning that collecting additional data points that are relevant to potential partners is something that they might want to consider adding to their devices.Challenges of monetizing IoT dataChallenges of monetizing IoT dataIn an interview with Doug Laney, Gartner’s chief data officer, Gregory Piatetsky asks about some challenges for organizations in monetizing information. While this interview is a general overview of all types of information, it can easily be applied to IoT data.Data quality: The IoT data that is being collected needs to be high-quality data. It will need to show the accuracy, completeness, integrity, timeliness and more for customers to trust the information being provided.Data quality:Determining types of information: Many companies may want IoT data in different forms that might not have been considered to fit their model. They might want more information on data points that were originally unrecorded. This will require flexibility to deliver these types of requests.Determining types of information:Classic product management/marketing approach: Because IoT data isn’t necessarily a physical product, it can cause some organizations to ignore typical activities that go into selling a physical device. This includes researching, designing, developing, packaging, promoting and supporting physical products or services.Classic product management/marketing approach:Protecting against unintended/unlicensed uses: Data can easily be copied, which can be great for licensing over and over but challenging to ensure against the customer using it in unintended ways. This means that contracts will need to be considered, requiring a licensed user to be trained on “safe and appropriate handling” of information products, enabling usage auditing and more.Protecting against unintended/unlicensed usesThe future of selling IoT dataThe future of selling IoT dataThis practice will continue to grow as more companies can tap into the power that IoT data can provide to others and how much they are willing to obtain that information. The IoT industry is growing, and even Japanese companies are working together to try to launch an IoT data-exchange platform by 2020 to help inspire new products and services.You can find example of companies finding ways to monetize IoT data. Samsung launched a service two years ago that will enable IoT device manufacturers and service providers to monetize IoT data. This allows you to partner up with Samsung and their Artik Cloud and provide ways to monetize the IoT data that it collects and earn revenue shares with devices that get used by third-party apps and services. Of course, this is one “ready-to-go” platform that can be implemented, but the process can be all up to the person.Just remember: Companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft thrive on collecting data and learning new ways to provide solutions. In this day and age of trying to be as efficient as possible, data is as valuable as it has ever been. Maybe that smart water system of yours that keeps track of leaks can be worth much more than you think."
New sensor development kit specially built for BLE radio,https://iot.eetimes.com/new-sensor-development-kit-specially-built-for-ble-radio/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/03/rsl10-sip-450x270.jpg,Technology Trends,"March 11, 2019","Well, this certainly looks to be useful. ON Semiconductor has just announced the launch of its new RSL10 Sensor Development Kit, which was specially designed to provide engineering teams with an intuitive sensor design platform built around the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio.This kit features 9 degrees of freedom (DoF) detection and environmental monitoring devices, including ambient light, pressure, relative humidity, and temperature sensors. It also includes an ultra-low-noise digital microphone, user-programmable RGB LED, three programmable pushbutton switches, and 64 Kb of EEPROM.The design engineer will appreciate the fact that ON Semiconductor’s new kit combines motion and environmental sensing with the ultra-low-power capabilities of the RSL10 Bluetooth 5 system-on-chip (SoC) to facilitate consumer and industrial IoT designs.For those wondering why BLE, it is worth pointing out that by and large the BLE is seen as a standard radio for smart sensor designs built around wireless communications. The RSL10 Bluetooth chip, specifically, comes in a 5.5-mm2 WLCSP, a 6 × 6-mm QFN package, and a system-in-package (SiP) with an integrated antenna.Worth highlighting is the fact that the RSL10 SiP also integrates a range of low-power sensors from Bosch Sensortec. For example, the highly integrated BME680 environmental sensor is used to detect a wide range of gases for air-quality measurements. It also includes the BMM150 geomagnetic sensor and the BHI160 smart sensor for high-accuracy motion sensing.Developers that use the kit will be able to connect to the sensor dev kit to monitor sensors and evaluate features through the RSL10 sense and control mobile application. Its app supports several cloud platforms for uploading the sensor data.Via our sister site Electronic Products"

And one of the more heavily relied upon components in most IoT applications is the sensor.Sensors are used to collect data across a wide range of products, from drones and automobiles to wearables and augmented reality headsets. According a recent study conducted by Newark element14, it is the environmental sensor that is most often used in IoT applications.This begs the obvious question: what is an environmental sensor? To put it succinctly, these components measure things like humidity, temperature and pressure. According to 38% of respondents, they are most often used in IoT designs. Next are motion sensors with 25% of respondents saying they rely on this component to gather data, then opto/image sensors with 19%, followed by health monitoring sensors with 8% and audio sensors at 4%.The survey also asked about the increased role of hardware in IoT design: according to the results, 50% of developers use single board computers like the Raspberry Pi because they’re ready-to-use embedded development platforms. 27% of the group said they prefer to use personal designs and 19% said they use development platforms provided by silicon vendors.Furthermore, 58% of developers prefer to design a complete solution for edge-to-cloud security themselves; this, as opposed to relying on third-party solution providers (which could add some additional costs). While this is certainly a sizeable majority,, some survey respondents said they use third-party providers for edge-to-cloud communications (21%), designing edge devices (18%) and for data center/analytics (18%).Finally, it’s worth pointing out that the most preferred connectivity protocol between edge devices and the cloud is Wi-Fi (66%), according to survey respondents. The surveyors state that this is likely due to Wi-Fi’s long-range connectivity, higher throughput and the latest low-power microprocessors with integrated Wi-Fi on the chip.The second most popular communications protocol is cellular – 4G/LTE (31%), followed by Bluetooth Low Energy (27%), LoRa (11%) and 1 sub-GHz (7%).To learn more, check out the full survey. "

To give you a sample of what was discussed, Dave pointed out to Matt how the IOT industry is now addressing big things like interoperability, security and then posed the question: What does that mean in the context of wireless connectivity and those devices?Matt Johnson’s response:For interoperability and security, specifically, the easy way, at least that I would think about it is, it’s not going to happen unless those things happen. The interoperability is kind of foundational or elemental to having that experience when people purchase something or put something together, it needs to work. And that’s actually still a major challenge and opportunity that’s out there in the industry. It’s one of the things we really loved about Z-Wave and our acquisition there, because Z-Wave’s really focused on, first and foremost, interoperability. And they already have two or three thousand products that are certified and guaranteed to work together, which is huge. On the security side, I don’t think you have to debate or convince anyone how important that is. But one thing that’s really exciting to us, in the first half of this year, Silicon Labs is going to be announcing what we call our Series Two or next generation of IOT products. So we have a platform that we do every generation, and in this new generation, we’ve really pushed the bar… raised the bar or pushed the envelope on security. So hardware-level, chip-level. And it’s going to allow user authentication, it’s going to allow IP protection, consumer data protection. Because one of the things that could really derail this is if the security isn’t what it needs to be. You can imagine all the scenarios, and some we can’t even imagine, about how this could go wrong. So I’m proud that we’ve been pretty proactive in investing in security before it was even a big deal.For interoperability and security, specifically, the easy way, at least that I would think about it is, it’s not going to happen unless those things happen.

New cellular IoT module brought to market – designed for both LTE-M and NB-IoT,https://iot.eetimes.com/new-cellular-iot-module-brought-to-market-designed-for-both-lte-m-and-nb-iot/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/01/nrf9160-450x270.jpg,Technology Trends,"January 7, 2019","Nordic Semiconductor has announced the official roll-out of the first device in its new nRF91 series. Per the company, this new cellular IoT module offers more security features than similar modules in the market today. That’s because the nRF9160 features both Arm’s TrustZone as well as CryptoCell security.As if that’s not impressive enough, the nRF9160 System-in-Package (SiP) is drop-in–ready with GCF, FCC, and CE certifications, enabling deployment in cellular networks and cellular IoT products worldwide.Per author Heather Hamilton:In its announcement, Nordic explained that it partnered with Qorvo to achieve a SiP that looks closer to an integrated chip than a module, leveraging Qorvo’s RF front end, advanced packaging, and MicroShield technology. The module is designed to support global operation with a single SiP variant thanks to Nordic’s multimode LTE-M/NB-IoT modem, SAW-less transceiver, and Qorvo’s custom RF front-end solution.The nRF9160 is the first IoT module to use Arm’s Cortex M-33 CPU core and is supported by 1 MB of Flash and 256 kB of RAM on-board memory. Other features include a broad range peripheral set, analog and digital interfaces, 32 GPIOs, a standalone modem with full LTE capability, and a multi-band RF front end.Also worth pointing out: The nRF9160 SiP also has integrated GPS support, which allows both GPS and cellular data to be used for more accurate positioning, said the company.For those curious, the new IoT module is supported by a development kit, SiP module samples, LTE-M firmware, and an SDK with an application example for cloud connectivity. Its meant to help engineers get a jumpstart with sensor-to-cloud IoT applications. Its also meant to serve as a quick, go-to resource for accessing Nordic’s cloud-based nRF Connect for Cloud management tool, PC-based nRF Connect for Desktop tool, and Segger Embedded Studio.At the moment, NB-IoT and GPS functionality is in limited sampling and will be available for evaluation through firmware updates in the first quarter of 2019.Via our sister site Electronic Products"

Per the International Telecommunication Union, the world produces approximately 45 million tons of electronic waste (e-waste) each year. And that number is expected to continue rising.You see, when the useful life of an electronic device comes to an end, how to properly dispose of it is a challenge. Electronic devices contain toxic components, which can be harmful to the environment. What’s more, because these devices often contain personal and proprietary data, improperly disposing of them also leaves sensitive data open to exploitation. As the average cost of a data breach continues to rise (according to IBM it is nearing $4 million), this is a growing problem as well.To address this issue head-on, the StEP Initiative was launched by the United Nations; however, more needs to be done to ensure the safety and well-begin of today’s global population as well as future generations to come.Right now, there are four worthwhile solutions to this issue:When an electronic device can’t be reused as a whole entity, it’s possible that some of its components might be safely recovered. Otherwise, the device can be recycled according to best-practice industry standards.But before we get to any of these steps, identifying and properly disposing of IoT devices requires a transparent, robust ITAD process. Thorough, certified data sanitization that is performed to accepted industry standards is the first step in sustainable technology management. And there are a few companies out there that can capably perform this service.Read the full story on our sister site EETimes"

Among the notable technologies: New, special purpose chips, increasingly sophisticated and low-cost sensors, combined hardware and software for trust platforms plus deployment of new wireless technologies, all of which are expected to emerge as some of the top strategic Internet of Things (IoT) technologies.The following is the full list for review:1: Artificial Intelligence (AI)1: Artificial Intelligence (AI)According to Gartner, 14.2 billion connected things are forecasted to be in use in 2019, and that this total will reach 25 billion by 2021, producing an immense volume of data which, in turn, will help make IoT meaningful as AI is applied to a wide range of IoT information.2: Infonomics and Data Broking2: Infonomics and Data BrokingOver the next half-decade, the buying and selling of IoT data will become a major part of many IoT systems. As such, organizations will need to understand the risks and opportunities related to data broking and set appropriate IT policies in place.3: IoT Governance3: IoT GovernanceAs the IoT grows, the need for a governance framework that ensures appropriate behavior in the creation, storage, use and deletion of information related to IoT technologies will become increasingly important. This ranges from simple technical tasks to more complex issues—and everything in between.4: New Wireless Networking Technologies for IoT4: New Wireless Networking Technologies for IoTIoT networking involves balancing a set of competing requirements like endpoint cost, power consumption, bandwidth and more. While no single networking technology optimizes all of these yet, new IoT networking technologies will soon provide even more choice and flexibility. In particular network technologies like 5G, the forthcoming generation of low earth orbit satellites, and backscatter networks could be explored further.5: Novel IoT User Experiences5: Novel IoT User ExperiencesThe IoT user experience (UX) will be driven by four factors: New sensors, new algorithms, new experience architectures and context, and socially aware experiences. With an increasing number of interactions occurring with things that don’t have screens and keyboards, organizations’ UX designers will be required to use new technologies and adopt new perspectives if they want to create a superior UX.6: Sensor Innovation6: Sensor InnovationThe sensor market will continue to mature through 2023: New sensors will enable a wider range of events to be detected, current sensors will reduce in price or be packaged in new ways to support new applications and new algorithms will emerge to gather even more information.7: Shift from Intelligent Edge to Intelligent Mesh7: Shift from Intelligent Edge to Intelligent MeshThe move from centralized and cloud to edge architectures is already under way in the IoT space; however, this is not the end point. That’s because the set of layers associated with edge architecture will evolve to a more unstructured architecture comprising of a wide range of “things” and services connected in a dynamic mesh which, in turn, will enable more flexible, intelligent and responsive IoT systems.8: Silicon Chip Innovation8: Silicon Chip InnovationGartner states that while the majority of current IoT endpoint devices use conventional processor chips, traditional instruction sets and memory architectures aren’t well-suited to all the tasks that endpoints need to perform. As such, the research firm expects that by 2023, new special-purpose chips will reduce the power consumption required to run a DNN, enabling new edge architectures and embedded DNN functions in low-power IoT endpoints to support new capabilities such as data analytics integrated with sensors, and speech recognition included in low cost battery-powered devices.9: Social, Legal and Ethical IoT9: Social, Legal and Ethical IoTAs the IoT becomes more widely deployed, a range of social, legal and ethical issues will grow in importance, including ownership of data and the deductions made from it; algorithmic bias; privacy; and compliance with regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation.10: Trusted Hardware and Operating System10: Trusted Hardware and Operating SystemBy 2023, Gartner expects to see the deployment of hardware and software combinations that together create more trustworthy and secure IoT systems. This will come about as the result of organizations currently not having control over the source and nature of the software and hardware being utilized in IoT initiatives.Read the full story on our sister site EETimes"
"To comply with GDPR, most data should remain at the edge",https://iot.eetimes.com/to-comply-with-gdpr-most-data-should-remain-at-the-edge/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/10/gdpr-3518254_1920-450x270.jpg,Technology Trends,"October 31, 2018","Barcelona–If there has been a theme capturing the attention of technology conferences’ attendees over the past two years, it would be GDPR.Barcelona–It doesn’t matter if the conversation is about wearables, 5G networks, Edge computing, payment systems, CCTV, or transit cards, at some point in the discussion the renowned four-letter acronym pops up. The recent IoT Solutions World Congress was no exception. During the session IoT, data and AI  as key levers of digital transformation,  Patrice Slupowski. Senior Vice-President Digital Innovation at Orange, argued that GDPR compliance is one the most challenging issues companies are facing when implementing IoT technologies.Slupowski praised the new regulation as the building stone to protect citizens from the dangers of data profiling and discrimination by algorithms.During his recent speech at the European Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners, Apple’s CEO Tim Cook praised the GDPR as an example that other governments should follow.“This year, you’ve shown the world that good policy and political will can come together to protect the rights of everyone. We should celebrate the transformative work of the European institutions tasked with the successful implementation of the GDPR…. It is time for the rest of the world, including my home country, to follow your lead.” Cook said.Worldwide, close to 8,000 new devices connect to the Internet every minute, 345 million per month, which will grow to an expected 50 billion by 2020. All these devices are designed to collect and transmit data.For example, most households in Europe and the US already have one connected device (wanted or not): the smart meter. Whether for electricity, gas, or water, smart meters collect thousands of data points per month, and sometimes every day.  smart meterThat data, attached to the resident’s account number, can be used to help the user choose a better service plan, adjust consumption, and improve the utility company’s forecast of the area demands. The same data, however, can also be used to determine the resident’s behavior, when the house or apartment is empty, what appliances are in use and, in some cases, how many people are on the premises. All of that without WiFi or any other internet connection service present in the house. Other examples include the increasing number of appliances on the market that are equipped with “smart features.” Smart TVs, refrigerators, washing machines, thermostats, etc. all these appliances, connected to the cloud via our WiFi and mobile apps, continuously send information about our habits, including what TV programs we watch, the food we buy, the clothes we wash and, obviously, the time we spend at home.Tim Cook was adamant about the dangers of over-collecting data: “These scraps of data, each one harmless enough on its own, are carefully assembled, synthesized, traded, and sold. Taken to its extreme, this process creates an enduring digital profile, and lets companies know you better than you may know yourself…. We shouldn’t sugarcoat the consequences: This is surveillance, and these stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich the companies that collect them.” This is surveillanceThe GDPR is explicit: Data collected should be used only to provide the service or services that users signed up for. The only exception that doesn’t require explicit user consent is data needed to comply with government regulations.Otherwise, any company collecting data requires opt-in consent from the user or customer. And a customer’s refusal to opt-in cannot be used to deny access to the product or service.That’s why it is essential to implement privacy-by-design and keep raw collected data at the edge.Going back to the smart meter example: It is legal for a utility company to aggregate the data collected by hundreds of smart meters in one area (i.e., a city block) using a local gateway, and continuously send that aggregated data to their data centers, as long as it doesn’t include any individual metering. That helps the company manage the grid, forecast electricity use, and detect any problems or fraud in the area without invading individual privacy.Obviously, at the end of every billing cycle, the utility company needs to collect the total consumption of each home, but it will not have insight into the habits of individual customers.The GDPR and similar regulations appearing in countries such as Brazil and Singapore, are here to stay. Some companies are being investigated, and there are countries already filing cases against large corporations.We need corporations to take the letter and spirit of privacy regulations such as GDPR seriously, ensuring that privacy is respected and also helping people to trust adopting new technologies.

We expect to be the biggest IoT event of the year with over 14,000 attendees.Additionally, on the exhibition floor, we have increased the number of exhibitors, and exhibition space, 30% over last year. Companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Huawei, are coming back with a more substantial presence, both at the exhibition and at the Congress.One fact that shows the importance of the IoTSWC is that many companies are planning to make several product announcements during the show.Blockchain is becoming one of the most critical technologies for digital transformation, and AI is adding the intelligence layer to IoT. Many industrial IoT offerings are starting to add such techniques in addition to edge and cloud computing, to leverage the full power of big data and the information collected by IoT devices. Blockchain enables services such as securing the supply chain and predictive maintenance.This year the testbed area will have a premium location in the exhibition area, right in front of the entrance, in the middle of the Pavillion. We are going to have new, exciting testbeds and case studies featured at the show.One example is Emergency One, the UK’s leading manufacturer of Fire, Rescue and Emergency Vehicles, which use Vodafone IoT to connect fire engines for improved safety and efficiency.Another compelling use case is coming from Alaska, where they are using IoT technology for the protection of Beluga whales. Aridea Solutions (West Virginia) was tasked to design a solution to monitor a natural gas leak that was detected approximately 6 kilometers offshore in the Cook Inlet, where only around 300 to 400 Beluga whales live.  Aridea designed a buoy equipped with a special wireless sensor platform to monitor air and water near the leak affecting the Beluga whales and other aquatic mammals. The sensors are providing crucial data for analyzing the environmental impacts of the leak until repairs are completed.There will be some special events organized by some of the exhibitors that will take place before and during the show. One example is Microsoft’s IoT in Action, a one day conference with the top executives of the firm on intelligent edge, cloud, and IoT security.The most important parallel conference for me, however, will be Women Leadership on IoT, taking place on Oct. 16th, where inspirational women leaders in Industrial IoT representing established corporations will offer their perspectives on integrating gender equality into the digital transformation movement.IoT Times is a Global Media Partner of the IoT Solutions World Congress and we will be covering the most important events and talks during the show.IoT Times is a Global Media Partner of the IoT Solutions World Congress and we will be covering the most important events and talks during the show."

The company is reportedly in the final stages of acquiring Mountain View, Calif.-based data analytics firm Treasure Data for $600 million. This comes on the heels of its acquisition in June of Stream Technologies, a unified connectivity management platform for IoT devices, and its investment in San Jose-based SWIM.ai.News of this latest acquisition comes from people close to the deal. It also comes prior to the company’s planned “major IoT announcement” on August 7.While nothing is official, author Nitin Dahad speculates on what this (supposed) acquisition means:When it comes to Arm, it seems like those in charge have recognized that the route to profitability has to be this bigger ecosystem sell, and hence, the acquisition strategy would make sense.For instance, the acquisition of Stream provides the physical connectivity platform for IoT networks covering several wireless protocols. At the time of acquisition, it is said to have been maintaining 770,000 managed subscribers and handling 2 TB of traffic per day. Stream provides companies with the ability to deploy an IoT device, find a network, self-authenticate, automatically provision, and connect to the lowest-cost channel, removing the need to interface with multiple different network systems and develop several business contracts for the network connectivity.When the acquisition was announced, Arm said that, together with its Mbed IoT device management platform, the combination will provide organizations with a scalable end-to-end IoT platform for managing, connecting, provisioning and updating devices. In addition, Stream is also expected to work with mobile industry association GSMA to create compliant embedded subscriber identity module (eSIM) solutions to ensure secure identity and optimal connectivity for IoT devices from the chip to the cloud.As for Treasure Data — whose customers include SoftBank, the owner of Arm — the company already provides data analytics solutions for automotive and IoT for firms like Pioneer, Mitsubishi, and Subaru. One of the company’s biggest selling points is its ability to ingest data from any connected device or machine, correlate data from multiple sources, and leverage machine learning to enable customers to act on the insights provided. It was founded by three Japanese entrepreneurs in California in 2011 and has received over $54 million in funding to date.Read the full story on our sister site EETimes"

Stream acquired by Arm to help expand IoT services,https://iot.eetimes.com/stream-acquired-by-arm-to-help-expand-iot-services/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/06/ARM-iot-services-450x270.jpg,Technology Trends,"June 13, 2018","Arm recently acquired Stream Technologies (Glasgow). The purpose behind the purchase, if you will, is to grow a business in paid services for devices on the Internet of Things. This unique move comes as the IoT is still in an early stage but widely seen to have huge potential with services expected to be one of its hottest sectors.For those unfamiliar, Stream, a private company founded in 2000, is widely known for its connectivity management software and services. At present, they are used by 770,000 devices carrying 2 terabytes of traffic daily. While the company is mainly focused on cellular, its offerings are network-agnostic; that is, it also supports LoRa and satellite nets carrying IP and non-IP data.Stream serves a wide variety of applications including asset tracking, smart meters, and the U.K.’s National Rail system. Its services include support for billing and the so-called embedded subscriber identity module (eSIM), a software-based cellular ID. Worth noting is that earlier this year, Arm rolled out software that it called Kigen OS to enable eSIM on its cores.Arm plans to integrate Stream’s products into its nascent Mbed IoT services. The company did not disclose how much it paid for Stream, the size of Stream’s revenues, or the size of its own nascent IoT services business.The acquisition is an example of how Arm is reaching beyond the processor core sector that it dominates with help from its new owner, Softbank. Arm already works with IBM to connect IoT deployments to the IBM Watson Cloud and plans other such deals.Hima Mukkamala, general manager of Arm’s IoT Cloud Services group, has a very optimistic outlook now that the deal is final.IoT services are “the carrot that everyone chases,” said Christopher Rommel, vice president of embedded research at market watcher VDC Research Group, Inc.Arm is growing a portfolio of IoT services around device connectivity and management. Image: Arm.Arm is growing a portfolio of IoT services around device connectivity and management. Image: Arm.Rommel admits he hadn’t heard of Stream prior to the acquisition; as such, he was slightly bullish on the deal.“Arm is well-positioned for this with its channel in software and tools. The challenge is walking the line between offering its own services and those of partners. It makes sense for them to go after services, but it’s a complex and crowded space.”Read the full story on our sister site EETimes"

Author Vivek Joshi, who is also CEO & Founder of Entytle, explains:Joshi’s answer: data science.He points out that the one question most manufacturers are asking every day is how can we leverage customer data (things like orders, service records, call center logs, sales opportunities) across a variety of system (like CRM, warranties, service contracts, etc…) to extract patterns of customer behavior and usage to predict customer needs?Naturally, this opens up several avenues of additional questions:How can these companies get better at predicting the health of drifted customers?How do they increase the linkage rate of customers so more assets are under contract?How do they ultimately improve the connect rate for our customers, so they can drive top-line revenue by recovering lost wallet share?Data science is able to provide answers to most of these questions. AI-driven platforms are helping B2B manufacturers harness the power of their historical and new customer data to increase installed base visibility, identify patterns and predict customer service and sales needs. Ultimately, it’s up to a company’s service, marketing and sales team to do something with these insights: which means that a certain degree of change management needs to happen too.Companies that embrace this approach are beginning to transform their aftermarket approach from being reactive to proactive. They are improving their connectivity with customers and as a result, are driving better outcomes for their customers.And all of this is improving the outlook for IoT and IIoT.Read the full story on our sister site EBNonline"

Will diversity in IoT market challenge ROI?,https://iot.eetimes.com/will-diversity-in-iot-market-challenge-roi/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/LPWA-operators-450x270.png,Technology Trends,"April 9, 2018","The Internet of Things (IoT) will to continue to grow in the years to come – the question, though, is how quickly and what sort of return investors will see when committing to a technology or solution. You see, market fragmentation has made it difficult to find actual, worthwhile return on investment (ROI).“It’s not just one product like a smartphone, its hundreds of different products, and the trick is creating enough products to meet demand,” said Mareca Hatler, director of research for ON World Inc.A recent report on low power wide area (LPWA) networks said that while expected revenues for LPWA systems and services will reach $56 billion by 2022, market fragmentation will wind up spreading this revenue across more than 40 unique IoT applications just for LPWA nets alone.ON World’s latest report projects the Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) version of LTE and the 900 MHz LoRa network will take leading roles in LPWA over the next few years. One of their chief rivals, Sigfox, will trail, in part a victim of the demand for unique designs.“Sigfox has millions of subscriber devices, but its challenge is getting enough devices to meet demand — it’s a product availability problem,” Hatler explained.The problem of needing to customize designs for IoT deployments is a challenge all vendors face; however, some feel it more than others.“One advantage for LoRa is it has a bigger ecosystem with more products. There are dozens of LoRa modules and gateways, Sigfox has a handful,” Hatler said.Unlicensed LPWA networks dominate today, but cellular IoT is coming on strong and apps are expanding. (Image: ON World)Unlicensed LPWA networks dominate today, but cellular IoT is coming on strong and apps are expanding. (Image: ON World)Author Rick Merritt points out that as of today, nearly two thirds of LPWA network operators are unlicensed ones such as LoRa and Sigfox, but cellular carriers are ramping their NB-IoT plans quickly. This will result in NB-IoT eventually making up more than half of the 1.3 billion LPWA nodes OnWorld forecasts will be deployed by 2025.“NB-IoT has the advantage in the next five to seven years. The question is only how fast it will happen. The network operators have so much scale they can offer disruptive pricing,” Hatler said, noting Deutsche Telecom will charge just $12 per NB-IoT node for ten years or 500 MBytes.Carriers are expected to drive wide availability as well as price. They can also offer good quality of service and as much as 5x more bandwidth than unlicensed LPWA nets, Hatler explained.Carriers in China have been quick to jump on NB-IoT. U.S. carriers rolled out a higher bandwidth LTE-M option first because it only required a software upgrade to their LTE networks. But in the last several months they have announced aggressive plans for NB-IoT, which typically requires carriers install some new hardware.Read the full story on our sister site EETimes"
What’s driving the rapid rise of edge computing?,https://iot.eetimes.com/whats-driving-the-rapid-rise-of-edge-computing/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/01/story17-450x270.jpg,Technology Trends,"March 29, 2018","The practice of edge computing within the Internet of Things (IoT) space is creating a bevy of new opportunities for embedded designers.It’s quickly being discovered that FPGAs can be used to better aggregate data. What’s more, once they’re in place, the technology can also process that data quickly and deliver real-time analytics. When coupled with DSP and multicore processors, intelligent nodes and gateways can all provide information that is significantly more useful back to the cloud, thereby reducing power consumption and extending battery life.Author Mark Patrick, in a cover story for Embedded World 2018, details the rise of edge computing in a technical article. From the paper’s introduction:Through the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), there has been significant interest generated in edge computing. Like Cisco fog computing, this means putting more processing power at the edge of the cloud, which helps to reduce the overall power consumption from the sensor node to the data centre. This represents a significant opportunity for embedded designers, who are demanding more sophisticated algorithms at the sensor and the gateway. While there has been considerable activity over the last few years in apps and software to support data centre hardware, the move to edge computing will need a much broader base of software, running on higher performance embedded systems.Hardware is becoming available in both the embedded and industrial markets that will address this. It generally utilises dual or quadcore processors, such as the KeyStone system on-a-chip offering from Texas Instruments at the nodes and Intel Corei7 in gateways from suppliers like ADLINK that are capable of handling both the sensor data and the analytics. This will be essential with tens of billions of IoT devices expected to connect to the network. Current IoT architectures tend to only deploy analytics in a data centre context once all the information has been collected, but as IoT deployments increase, data will simply not be provided quickly enough. To be truly useful, analytics will really need to be placed at the true edge, directly into the devices. “The situation we have at the moment is that data is being sent to a massive data lake where it is not being used,” said Chad Boulanger, Global VP of Business Development for IoT Analytics at software development company Greenwave Systems. “As the IoT continues to grow, this is not going to add value. The only way to do that is to do as much as possible at the true edge of networks – within the actual devices – so that the machine knows that something is wrong right there and can take appropriate action. If the data has to travel from another part of the network, that could have a detrimental impact.”Read the full article on our sister site Internet of Things Design Zone"

DecaWave and others targeted the 802.15.4a version of UWB for personal-area location where it delivers centimeter accuracy over 100-200 meter distances.Today, nearly a half-dozen companies offer such UWB chips. DecaWave claims it alone has sold more than 4 million chips, has two users now consuming more than a million a year, and other customers ready to move from trials to deployments.According to Mickael Viot, vice president of marketing at DecaWave, this sudden growth calls for a UWB alliance that can certify interoperability standards, deal with global regulatory issues and promote the technology. Viot adds that he’s hoping to get a trade group launched this year.Other UWB chip vendors who would be invited include 3db of Switzerland, Alereon, Bespoon, Novelda, Time Domain and Ubisense. The group would also include OEMs and end users.A larger chunk of DecaWave’s funding targets a next-generation chip made in a 40nm process. The design will integrate many of the 27 external components the current chip requires to approach highly integrated Bluetooth Low Energy chips that use as few as five external components.DecaWave’s existing chip rides its DWM1001 module.

The wireless circuitry is encapsulated under a metal shield, which has allowed the company to certify the entire board as a radio module under FCC rules; this, in turn will significantly reduce the cost of conformance testing Raspberry Pi-based products.According to Eben Upton, co-founder of the Raspberry Pi Foundation, this is significant for the company’s commercial base. While the Raspberry Pi Foundation may have started out with a mission to bring more people into electronics design and computer programming, the module is also a commercial success in mainstream products.“We’ve seen a lot of people designing Raspberry Pi into their own products, and this has become an important part of our commercial business, which of course funds our charitable work,” Upton said. “Many of the features we’ve incorporated into 3+, particularly the modular certification and thermal improvements, have been driven by feedback from the design community.”Upton also suggested that future generations of products will be more so driven by what designers are looking for: “While we have a policy of not discussing future products, with Raspberry Pi 3B+ out of the way we’ll be turning our attention to what we do next,” he said. “We’ll be speaking to the design community about what they’d like to see in a next-gen Raspberry Pi, but I’d be surprised to see any significant change in the feature mix: it’s likely to be ‘more’ of everything we have today.”Read the full story on our sister site EETimes.com"

It provides up to 5 V output voltage and current measurements with a sample rate of 4 ksps for the range of 1 µA – 5 A. An additional measurement channel is available via ADC in the expansion port, which also provides UART, Digital I/O and SENSE pins.For more information visit shop.qoitech.comRead the full story on our sister site PowerElectronicsNews.com"
New validation program for IoT software vendors will make IoT software market safer and speedier,https://iot.eetimes.com/new-validation-program-for-iot-software-vendors-will-make-iot-software-market-safer-and-speedier/,https://iot.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/IMC-chart-450x270.png,Technology Trends,"March 19, 2018","There has been an explosion of IoT software platforms in recent years – in fact, more than 400 exist presently. And with so many systems to choose from, there’s bound to be some confusion.The International M2M Council (IMC) is looking to solve this issue by creating an open standard for obtaining quotes and certification of potential vendors, with the goal being to not only make the IoT marketplace safer, but encourage continued growth.Author Richard Quinnell explains:The problem here, Quinnell argues, is that many vendors are without the proven track record needed in order to win an RFP. This, in turn, leaves buyers hesitant to contract these vendors without extensive investigation, a process that slows down the launch of a product or solution, and something that also introduces a higher level of risk.According to IMC-funded surveys, the 25,000 IoT buyers within the Council’s membership would welcome the introduction of a standardized RFP document template to help in defining their IoT software needs, to which potential vendors could respond.Additionally, 83% of those surveyed said that they would also welcome a mechanism by which third-party consultants could help certify vendor compliance with an RFP and vet potential vendors. With such mechanisms in place, vendors could more quickly and completely prepare RFPs and be assured that the bids they get back are from proven reliable vendors and conform to the requirements.IMC’s validation program for IoT software vendors, which includes three key elements in its evaluation process.

Image source: IoT M2M Council.Based on these results, the IMC has begun work on a program that aims to stimulate, streamline, and strengthen the safety of IoT buyer/vendor interactions. There are two parts: The first part is an RFP template, formed in an open collaboration process with input from more than 100 potential IoT buyers and released at CES. The template provides a standardized way of expressing the buyer’s project requirements and information needs for evaluating responses, helping prevent inconsistent terminology and ensure completeness.The second part of the IMC’s program is the establishment of a third-party vendor validation process, conducted by Beecham Research, which pre-qualifies potential responders to RFPs coming from IMC members.Read the full story on our sister site ElectronicProducts.com"
